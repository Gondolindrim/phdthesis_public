# Dynamic Phasor Theory of Electrical Circuits under Nonstationary Regimens

This is the public repository of my doctoral thesis. You will find the PDF in the [releases page](https://github.com/Gondolindrim/phdthesis_public/releases).

As of August 2025, the source code for the LaTeX document is not available because the thesis was defended and approved but feedback from the committee was not yet applied. Once the feedback is there I will publish the TeX source files too.

## Licensing and citing
