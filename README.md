## A note on compiling

If you want to read the thesis, just download the PDF using the link above. If for some reason you need to compile it (like to get the images), the thesis contains 100 TikZ generated figures which are externalized and take roughly 20 minutes to compile, so grab a cofee and lay back.

## Licensing and citing

The source code for the thesis is available including simulations and figures. The repository is released under the MIT license, so basically use everything **with proper citation**. If you use any image, formula, code snippet please cite it. Please help me have citations and get a job.

**The only resource that is not redistributable is the EESC-USP ``Athena logo''** in the images folder, but I still have it in the repo because the image is needed for compilation of the document. That is licensed under its own terms, available at the [university's website](https://eesc.usp.br/noticias/logotipos.php) (in portuguese, last accessed september 15, 2025).

This thesis is public, therefore fully reproductible and redistributable if given the proper citaition. The repository contains a bibtex file you can use if you use LaTeX (which you should by the way), or use the following:
