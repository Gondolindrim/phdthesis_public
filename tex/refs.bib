  abstract = {The classical complex phasor representation of sinusoidal voltages and currents is generalized to arbitrary waveforms. The method relies on the so-called analytic signal using the Hilbert transform. This naturally leads to the notion of a time-varying power triangle and its associated instantaneous power factor. Additionally, it is shown for linear systems that Budeanu's reactive power can be related to energy oscillations, but only in an average sense. Furthermore, Budeanu's distortion power is decomposed into a part representing a measure of the fluctuation of power around the active power and a part that represents the fluctuation of power around Budeanu's reactive power. The results are presented for single-phase systems.},

  abstract = {Photovoltaic (PV) systems are one of the most important renewable energy resources (RER). It has limited energy efficiency leading to increasing the number of PV units required for certain input power i.e. to higher initial cost. To overcome this problem, maximum power point tracking (MPPT) controllers are used. This work introduces a comparative study of seven MPPT classical, artificial intelligence (AI), and bio-inspired (BI) techniques: perturb and observe (P\&O), modified perturb and observe (M-P\&O), incremental conductance (INC), fuzzy logic controller (FLC), artificial neural network (ANN), adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS), and cuckoo search (CS). Under the same climatic conditions, a comparison between these techniques in view of some criteria's: efficiencies, tracking response, implementation cost, and others, will be performed. Simulation results, obtained using MATLAB/SIMULINK program, show that the MPPT techniques improve the lowest efficiency resulted without control. ANFIS is the highest efficiency, but it requires more sensors. CS and ANN produce the best performance, but CS provided significant advantages over others in view of low implementation cost, and fast computing time. P\&O has the highest oscillation, but this drawback is eliminated using M-P\&O. FLC has the longest computing time due to software complexity, but INC has the longest tracking time.},

After dealing with a sound analytical model on the PV cell, the paper presents a clear modeling under Simulink. The model is designed to take excitation from three inputs including temperature, irradiance and voltage. Simulations were run and results in terms of peak power and current were analyzed. In total the similarities were quite satisfactory as compared to previous works. However, some little differences in the responses of the model to various inputs were observed. These results, further confirm the novelty of the proposed model.},

Based on the energy-only resource adequacy mechanism utilized in ERCOT, effective competition is defined by two major elements. The first element is active demand-side participation in the market and the second one is defining optimal price cap in the market to achieve efficient scarcity prices. Then, a dynamic model is proposed and different scenarios of effective competition are applied to two different market designs; energy-only market and energy market with capacity payments. Results show that increasing the price cap to approach to the Value of Lost Load (VOLL) and higher levels of demand-side participation in the market reduce the risk of generation inadequacy and mitigate the supply security problem in the investigated electricity market. Also, utilizing effective competition in energy markets with capacity payment mechanism triggers more investment in comparison with energy-only markets. {\copyright} 2014 IEEE.},

However, Smart grid is dependent on a huge amount of data which are transmitted between different parts of the system and central controller through an extensive communication network in order to control the system. This information transmission makes Smart grid vulnerable to cyber attacks that can give rise to catastrophic consequences. In this paper, we employ an algorithm to detect and estimate attacks on smart grids. In this algorithm due to the stochastic nature of the power system, we design a Kalman filter to estimate state variables and the output of the system and use a {$\chi$}2-detector to detect attack occurrence. The efficiency of this algorithm for smart grid is evaluated under Scaling, Ramp, Random and DOS attacks by numerical simulation.},

The conventional fixed voltage reference method is the simplest method for tracking, but it does not obtain good MPPT efficiency because the maximum power point (MPP) voltage changes at different insolation levels. In reality, an approximately linear slope is formed when connecting the MPPs measured from the highest insolation level to the lowest. Utilizing this characteristic, a BJT, which has a similar electrical property, is used to implement a variable voltage reference that improves the accuracy of the MPP voltage when the insolation changes. The proposed circuit is simple and easy to implement, and it can track the MPP very quickly without the need for a digital controller or PID controller. Hence, the circuits cost and complexity are reduced. Experimental results are given to verify the feasibility of the proposed MPPT method.},

It enhances the reliability and resiliency of the power network and reduces the cost of energy. Although networked MGs have attracted significant research interests, validation of various studies is difficult because there is no benchmark test system available for such systems. A benchmark test system can be used to validate static and dynamic studies related to the networking of multiple MGs, such as optimal power flow, energy management, control, stability, and protection. To fill in this research gap, a benchmark test system for networked MGs is proposed in this article, where four independent MGs are interconnected and coordinated. Required data, such as line parameters, load data, and power generating sources, have been prepared for each MG considered in the system. To provide a general test platform, typical datasets are made as close to practical MGs as possible. Parameters used to evaluate reliability indices and resiliency measures of the system are given for the entire test system. Future potential studies, which can be tested on the proposed benchmark test system, are discussed.},

  abstract = {The smart grid is an unprecedented opportunity to shift the current energy industry into a new era of a modernized network where the power generation, transmission, and distribution are intelligently, responsively, and cooperatively managed through a bi-directional automation system. Although the domains of smart grid applications and technologies vary in functions and forms, they generally share common potentials such as intelligent energy curtailment, efficient integration of Demand Response, Distributed Renewable Generation, and Energy Storage. This paper presents a comprehensive review categorically on the recent advances and previous research developments of the smart grid paradigm over the last two decades. The main intent of the study is to provide an application-focused survey where every category and sub-category herein are thoroughly and independently investigated. The preamble of the paper highlights the concept and the structure of the smart grids. The work presented intensively and extensively reviews the recent advances on the energy data management in smart grids, pricing modalities in a modernized power grid, and the predominant components of the smart grid. The paper thoroughly enumerates the recent advances in the area of network reliability. On the other hand, the reliance on smart cities on advanced communication infrastructure promotes more concerns regarding data integrity. Therefore, the paper dedicates a sub-section to highlight the challenges and the state-of-the-art of cybersecurity. Furthermore, highlighting the emerging developments in the pricing mechanisms concludes the review.},

The methods are mostly freely available in different programming languages and with different interfaces. Accessing them using a unified interface is a need not only of the research community and for education purposes but also to make them available in industrial contexts. An industrial model of a dynamic system is usually not just a set of differential equations. The models today may contain discrete controllers, impacts or friction resulting in discontinuities that need to be handled by a modern solver in a correct and efficient way. Additionally, the models may produce an enormous amount of data that puts strain on the simulation software. In this paper, Assimulo is presented. It is a unified high-level interface to solvers of ordinary differential equations and is designed to satisfy the needs in research and education together with the requirements for solving industrial models with discontinuities and data handling. It combines original classical and modern solvers independent of their programming language with a well-structured Python/Cython interface. This allows to easily control parameter setting and discontinuity handling for a wide range of problem classes.},

Despite this, the knowledge on the performance of commonly used photovoltaic device models and their parameter estimation techniques in these scenarios is very limited. Accurate models are an essential tool for conducting feasibility analyses and component dimensioning for indoor photovoltaic systems. In this paper, we therefore conduct a comparison of the one- and two-diode models with parameters estimated based on two well-known methods. We evaluate the models' performance on datasets of photovoltaic panels intended for indoor use, and illumination conditions to be expected in indoor environments lit by artificial light sources. The results demonstrate that the one-diode model outperforms the two-diode model with respect to the estimation of the overall I-V characteristics. The two-diode model results instead in lower maximum power point errors. Both models show a sensitivity to initial conditions, such as the selection of the diode ideality factor, as well as the curve form of the photovoltaic panel to be modeled, which has not been acknowledged in previous research.},

Renewable power sources connected in an autonomous local grid are a real opportunity for these communities. These weak electrical grids composed by several microsources, energy storage systems and loads can be considered as islanded microgrids. As it is disconnected from the main grid, the frequency and the voltage of the microgrid have to be controlled. The frequency is generally controlled maintaining the power balance between generation and consumption, using energy storage or dump loads. The voltage regulation is approached in different ways, according with the controller design objectives and the nature of the loads connected to the grid.

  abstract = {The open access book covers a large class of nonlinear systems with many practical engineering applications. The approach is based on the extension of linear systems theory using the Volterra series. In contrast to the few existing treatments, our approach highlights the algebraic structure underlying such systems and is based on Schwartz's distributions (rather than functions). The use of distributions leads naturally to the convolution algebras of linear time-invariant systems and the ones suitable for weakly nonlinear systems emerge as simple extensions to higher order distributions, without having to resort to ad hoc operators. The result is a much-simplified notation, free of multiple integrals, a conceptual simplification, and the ability to solve the associated nonlinear differential equations in a purely algebraic way. The representation based on distributions not only becomes manifestly power series alike, but it includes power series as the description of the subclass of memory-less, time-invariant, weakly nonlinear systems. With this connection, many results from the theory of power series can be extended to the larger class of weakly nonlinear systems with memory. As a specific application, the theory is specialised to weakly nonlinear electric networks. The authors show how they can be described by a set of linear equivalent circuits which can be manipulated in the usual way. The authors include many real-world examples that occur in the design of RF and mmW analogue integrated circuits for telecommunications. The examples show how the theory can elucidate many nonlinear phenomena and suggest solutions that an approach entirely based on numerical simulations can hardly suggest. The theory is extended to weakly nonlinear time-varying systems, and the authors show examples of how time-varying electric networks allow implementing functions unfeasible with time-invariant ones. The book is primarily intended for engineering students in upper semesters and in particular for electrical engineers. Practising engineers wanting to deepen their understanding of nonlinear systems should also find it useful. The book also serves as an introduction to distributions for undergraduate students of mathematics},

In order to describe fast dynamic behavior and rapid amplitude and phase variations, more accurate dynamic models based on the dq0 transformation are used. To better understand the differences between these two models, in this work we compare their relative accuracy when applied to large-scale transmission networks. In this light, the present work describes the two types of models using similar terminology, which is based on dq0 quantities. Based on this result, we show that quasi-static models may be obtained from dq0 models at low frequencies, and that there exists a frequency range in which quasi-static model approximates the dq0 model well. The obtained results allow to estimate the frequency after which the quasi-static model cannot accurately describe the system dynamics, and dq0 models should be used instead.},

The microgrid concept provides a quite appealing solution for overcoming the challenges of integrating renewable energy sources and distributed generators into power grids. Advances in the microgrids control have improved the microgrids potential to be integrated into the conventional electrical systems in a higher capacity. This improvement not only covers their internal control performance and connection/disconnection procedures in order to limit the negative dynamic impacts in the network and other connected microgrids, but also includes the grid support functionalities to enhance the global operation of distribution networks. In this paper, a general overview of the main control loops is presented. The microgrid control strategies are classified into four control levels: local, secondary, central and global, where the first three levels are associated with the operation of the microgrid itself, and the fourth level demonstrates to the coordinated operation of the microgrid and neighbor grids as well as the main/host grid.},

The frequency control combination in this hybrid system can achieve by using a virtual synchronous generator (VSG), the role of VSG is used as the interface between the AC bus and DC bus. Solar PV-Battery working with an inverter it mimics the property of conventional generator, it called VSG. If PV-Battery is not able to supply the required power to the load such condition the diesel generator help to fulfill this demand, and such a combination called PV/Battery/DG-VSG.

  abstract = {Nearly all nontrivial real-world systems are nonlinear dynamical systems. Chaos describes certain nonlinear dynamical systems that have a very sensitive dependence on initial conditions. Chaotic systems are always deterministic and may be very simple, yet they produce completely unpredictable and divergent behavior. Systems of nonlinear equations are difficult to solve analytically, and scientists have relied heavily on visual and qualitative approaches to discover and analyze the dynamics of nonlinearity. Indeed few fields have drawn as heavily from visualization methods for their seminal innovations: from strange attractors, to bifurcation diagrams, to cobweb plots, to phase diagrams and embedding. Although the social sciences are increasingly studying these types of systems, seminal concepts remain murky or loosely adopted. This paper has three aims. First it discusses several visualization methods to critically analyze and understand the behavior of nonlinear dynamical systems. Second it introduces to an interdisciplinary audience the foundations of nonlinear dynamics, chaos, fractals, self-similarity, and the limits of prediction -- arguing that information visualization is a key way to engage with these concepts. Finally it presents Pynamical, a tool to visualize and explore nonlinear dynamical systems' behavior.},

  abstract = {1. An upper bound for the norm of a system of ordinary differential equations can be obtained by comparison with a related first order differential equation, [4; 8]. This first order equation depends on an upper bound for the norm of the right side of the system. Recently, it has been pointed out [l; 6] that this same upper bound also gives a lower bound for the norm of the solution in terms of another first order equation. Most of the known explicit bounds, as well as criteria for global existence and boundedness, can be obtained from such comparison theorems, together with a detailed analysis of the resulting first order equations. The same approach also yields information on the approach of a solution to a limit. As suggested in [l ], bounds for approximate local solutions can also be obtained in this way. The bounds given in [l ] are sometimes difficult or impossible to calculate explicitly, but it is possible to give slightly weaker bounds, which are more easily calculated. The main conclusion to be drawn from this paper is that the comparison method provides not only a powerful tool for obtaining bounds for solutions, but also a unified approach to many such problems. 2. Consider the system of ordinary differential equations (1) x' = f(t, x), where x and/are <<-dimensionalvectors, and 0 {\textquestiondown}t {$<$} oo. We assume that f(t, x) is continuous for 0{\^ }t{$<$}<<{$>$}, {\textbackslash}x{\textbackslash}{$<<$}x{$>$}, but we require no assumptions on / to assure the uniqueness of solutions of (1), as our arguments do not require uniqueness.

  abstract = {Massive integration of converter-interfaced distributed energy resources (CDERs) has resulted in many emerging stability issues and significantly complicated the dynamics of active distribution networks (ADNs). Large quantities of CDER systems with complex structures, time-varying parameters and 'black-box' controllers not only make the system modelling nearly an impossible task, but also considerably increase the dimension of dynamic models and thus the computational burden for the model-based stability analysis and control. Distribution-level phasor measurement unit (D-PMU) technology has a superior capability of monitoring, analyzing and controlling the real-time system dynamics. This paper provides a comprehensive overview on the state-of-the-art techniques of dynamics monitoring, analysis and control based on D-PMU technology in ADNs. A special emphasis is placed on the emerging instability incidents induced by CDERs. Although stability monitoring, analysis and control techniques based on PMU technology are well established in the transmission systems, substantial research efforts are required to extend these techniques to deal with the different dynamic characteristics of distribution systems. The application of big-data analytics in analyzing D-PMU data streams becomes prevalent, which can dig more information and thus provide more effective measures for stability analysis and control of ADNs.},

However, for nonunity input power factor operations and high-mains-frequency applications, there are input current distortions in the 3TSMC. Further analysis reveals that the actual injection current cannot track the reference without error in the conventional harmonic current injection circuit, resulting in the current distortions. Therefore, an improved circuit is proposed, which is based on the asymmetric H-bridge and does not need extra energy storage components or current sensors. The injection current in the improved circuit can follow the reference without error by injection current modulation, which means that the input current distortions are suppressed significantly. All theoretical considerations are verified by experimental results taken on a 3-kVA prototype.},

First, compared with the conventional matrix converter, the 3TSMC suffers from larger volume due to the inductor in the harmonic current injection circuit. In the proposed system, the harmonic injection current is synthesized by the field current of SDSEM and the injection inductor is removed. Then, the control strategy is proposed to decouple the current injection control and field current control, which means that the harmonic current and the field current can be regulated flexibly. Finally, a prototype is built to evaluate the proposed system and control strategy. Furthermore, the proposed 3TSMC-fed drive with the corresponding control strategy is also suitable for the other dc-excited three-phase sinusoidal ac machines, such as wound rotor synchronous machines.},

Unfortunately, this offline practice is inadequate to deal with current operating environments. For years, direct methods have held the promise of providing real-time stability assessments; however, these methods have presented several challenges and limitations. This book addresses these challenges and limitations with the BCU methods developed by author Hsiao-Dong Chiang. To date, BCU methods have been adopted by twelve major utility companies in Asia and North America. In addition, BCU methods are the only direct methods adopted by the Electric Power Research Institute in its latest version of DIRECT 4.0. Everything you need to take full advantage of BCU methods is provided, including: Theoretical foundations of direct methods Theoretical foundations of energy functions BCU methods and their theoretical foundations Group-based BCU method and its applications Numerical studies on industrial models and data Armed with a solid foundation in the underlying theory of direct methods, energy functions, and BCU methods, you'll discover how to efficiently solve complex practical problems in stability analysis.

  abstract = {This paper proposes a real-time hardware-in-the loop (HIL) testing platform for microgrid cybersecurity analysis. The developed platform emulates the microgrid network, the distributed energy resources (DER) and their corresponding local controllers on a real-time digital simulator (RTDS). The main microgrid controller functions are implemented on a separate digital controller. The microgrid communication network is implemented in hardware and the messages exchanged are compliant with the IEC 61850 generic object oriented substation event (GOOSE) messaging protocol. An impact assessment of false data injection (FDI) cyber-attacks on the critical microgrid control functions, specifically, loss of load due to under frequency load shedding (UFLS) has been conducted. Mitigation solutions that enhance the resilience of the microgrid to FDI attacks have been proposed. Real-time simulation results are used to quantify the attack's impact and the mitigation scheme effectiveness on the dynamic frequency response of microgrids in terms of reliability metrics, including the amount of load lost, the frequency nadir and the time needed to reach frequency stability. A 25 kV distribution system adapted from a utility feeder and reconfigured as a microgrid has been used as the benchmark test system. Applicable utility grid codes and standards are considered throughout.},

  abstract = {Recently, many signal-processing techniques, such as fast Fourier transform, short-time Fourier transform, wavelet transform (WT), and wavelet packet transform (WPT), have been applied to detect, identify, and classify power-quality (PQ) disturbances. For research on PQ analysis, it is critical to apply the appropriate signal-processing techniques to solve PQ problems. In this paper, a new time-frequency analysis method, namely, the Gabor-Wigner transform (GWT), is introduced and applied to detect and identify PQ disturbances. Since GWT is an operational combination of the Gabor transform (GT) and the Wigner distribution function (WDF), it can overcome the disadvantages of both. GWT has two advantages which are that it has fewer cross-term problems than the WDF and higher clarity than the GT. Studies are presented which verify that the merits of GWT make it adequate for PQ analysis. In the case studies considered here, the various PQ disturbances, including voltage swell, voltage sag, harmonics, interharmonics, transients, voltage changes with multiple frequencies and voltage fluctuation, or flicker, will be thoroughly investigated by using this new time-frequency analysis method. {\copyright} 2009 IEEE.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a robust optimal control strategy for an energy storage system of a grid-connected microgrid. The robust optimal control guarantees the highest possible economic benefit of the control schedule even under the worst case net demand prediction error conditions. Several robust optimization approaches are proposed to formulate a fast optimal control problem. The global optimum of a concise control problem can be found within a short computation time using mixedinteger linear programming. The rolling horizon controller of the energy management system periodically updates the control schedule by solving the control problem. The state of charge of an energy storage system is precisely calculated by the piecewise linearization technique using nonlinear efficiency maps. External working conditions such as peak control and demand response can be dynamically applied during the optimization process. The proposed strategy provides control robustness in terms of cost reduction, precise control, and external effect. Future study will focus on the development of a robust control strategy that considers both the worst and best cases of cost reduction.},

  abstract = {The aim of this study is the extent of direct methods for the study of voltage stability in power systems. Because of the diversity of devices with different speed of action, time-scales properties were explored to enable this extension. This research work has as contributions (i) establishing a general methodology for stability analysis of electric power systems on time scales and (ii) the extent of direct methods for the analysis of stability in time-scales scales of electric power systems. Based on the theory of singularly perturbed systems, we propose a general algorithm of stability analysis in time-scales electric power systems and develop the theoretical foundations of this algorithm to validate the decomposition of stability analysis in time scales. Thus, the stability analysis of a power system can be decomposed in the stability analysis of their corresponding fast and slow subsystems of lower order. These fundamentals fill the gap that existed between the stability analysis in the short-term and mid-term and establishes a relationship between them. In particular, the quasi steady state method (QSS) for stability analysis of the mid-term scale, which presupposes that the fast dynamics are stable and transient stability analysis are particular cases of the algorithm proposed. From the fundamentals of decomposition of time scales stability analysis, the direct methods of stability analysis will be extended, in particular CUEP method initially developed for transient stability analysis, for the mid-term stability problem via time-scale analysis. This extension is important because the direct methods are fast, and enable the development of voltage stability analysis techniques that are suitable for real time applications. The proposed methodology was tested in small power systems with good results in the evaluation of operating times of the control and protection equipment, also providing a better understanding of the stabilization mechanisms of the analyzed power systems.

To solve such problems, innumerous small scale projects have been implemented around the world either on the improvement of cooking stoves, biogas and others, as well as in generating electricity in decentralized systems. We discuss here the "large scale approach" to solve these problems in Brazil through the introduction of LPG (liquid petroleum gas) in Brazil 70 years ago, all over the country, as a cooking fuel that replaced significantly the use of fuel wood in rural areas. In addition to that, we describe the governmental program (Luz para Todos - LPT - Light for all) introduced more recently to extend the electricity grid to around 10 million people, reducing considerably the number of people without access to electricity in the rural areas of the country. Such experiences and the corresponding lessons learned could be replicated in other developing countries, contributing significantly to poverty alleviation. {\copyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

AC based design criteria are of limit usability, because of their large signal operation. This paper presents an alternative design approach for ring amplifiers. A set of cost functions and parameters is developed and the parameters' effect on the amplifier's stability, accuracy and power consumption is explained in detail. The optimization process is derived from a simple ring-amplifier model and a stability criterion. This criterion is analyzed in the context of circuit parameters, design constraints and other ring-amplifier designs. A new battery-based self-biased ring-amplifier architecture is introduced and the first stage integrator of a switched-capacitor Delta-Sigma modulator is realized using the described ring-amplifier architecture. The proposed optimization process is successfully performed using 180 nm and 40 nm technology nodes (second node with two supply voltages) and the three designs are analyzed and compared. The optimization process is derived from a basic ring-amplifier model and can be applied to other ring-amplifier structures.},

Unfortunately, the main drawbacks of these definitions have not been noticed. Namely, the Budeanu reactive and distortion powers do not possess any attributes which might be related to the power phenomena in the circuit. Moreover, their values do not provide any information which could enable the design of compensating circuits. Also, the distortion power value does not provide any information about waveform distortion.

  abstract = {n 2013, the California Independent System Operator published the ``duck chart,'' which shows a significant drop in mid-day net load on a spring day as solar photovoltaics (PV) are added to the system. The chart raises concerns that the conventional power system will be unable to accommodate the ramp rate and range needed to fully utilize solar energy, particularly on days characterized by the duck shape. This could result in ``overgeneration'' and curtailed renewable energy, increasing its costs and reducing its environmental benefits. This paper explores the duck chart in detail, examining how much PV might need to be curtailed if additional grid flexibility measures are not taken, and how curtailment rates can be decreased by changing grid operational practices. It finds that under business-as-usual types of assumptions and corresponding levels of grid flexibility in California, solar penetrations as low as 20\% of annual energy could lead to marginal curtailment rates that exceed 30\%. However, by allowing (or requiring) distributed PV and storage (including new installations that are part of the California storage mandate) to provide grid services, system flexibility could be greatly enhanced. Doing so could significantly reduce curtailment and allow much greater penetration of variable generation resources in achieving a 50\% renewable portfolio standard. Overall, the work described in this paper points to the need to fully integrate distributed resources into grid system planning and operations to allow maximum use of the solar resource.},

The consequence is that, during electromechanical transients triggered by large contingencies, transmission of electrical power may take place in a wide spectrum well beyond the single fundamental component. Traditional modeling approaches rely on the phasor representation derived from the Fourier Transform (FT) of the signal under analysis. During large transients, though, FT-based analysis may fail to accurately identify the fundamental component parameters, in terms of amplitude, frequency and phase. Taking inspiration from the theory on analytic signals, this paper proposes a different approach to model signals of power systems electromechanical transients based on the Hilbert transform (HT). We compare FT- and HT-based approaches during representative operating conditions, i.e., amplitude modulations, frequency ramps and step changes, in synthetic and real-world datasets. We further validate the approaches using a contingency analysis on the IEEE 39-bus.},

  abstract = {Blondel treated salient pole machines by resolving the fundamental space component of m. m. f. along the two axes of symmetry the direct axis of the pole, and the quadrature axis between poles. Using this idea and applying harmonic analysis, Blondevs theory has been extended in the present paper to a comprehensive system of treatment in which the effect of harmonic m. m. fsy as well as the fundamental and also of field m. m. f. in the quadrature axis, as well as in the direct have been taken into account. It is shown that the ``armature leakage flux'' which causes reactance voltage drop in synchronous operation comprises all fluxes due to armature currents which generate fundamental voltage except the space fundamental component, the latter constituting the total flux of ``armature reaction.'' Impressing upon the variable air-gap permeance those space harmonics of m. m. f. which are due to the fundamental time component of current and which therefore rotate at various fractional speeds produces odd space harmonics of flux rotating at many different speeds and in opposite directions. Some of these listed in Table I produce fundamental voltage, but most of them generate time harmonics. The former, which are reactive voltages, are only those of the nth space order rotating at one nth speed that is, those which correspond in space order and speed to the harmonic m. m. fs. The corresponding reactances are definitely defined in Appendix C in terms of permeance coefficients, and means are outlined for quantitative determination of such coefficients from graphically constructed field plots. Although, strictly, there areas many field plots required as there are significant m. m.f. harmonics, an approximation, developed in Appendix B, is given in which only one plot is necessary, other permeance waves being derived therefrom. It is shown that only the average term and the second space harmonic of the permeance series affect the fundamental voltage- Hence, unless it is required to calculate the harmonic voltages, only those two terms of the permeance series need to be determined. In the application of the results, the fundamental voltages thus produced by the armature currents are superposed upon that due to current in the field winding, which latter has been previously treated. This gives the vector diagram, Fig. 19, from which the steady state relations are set down in equations. In Part II, the steady-state angle-power relations are developed, including an interpretation of the ``reluctance term11 in the power or torque equation. In Appendix D, the vector diagram for salient pole machines is interpreted in terms of the well-known Potier diagram for cylindrical rotor machines. Also the effect of saturation both on anglepower relation and on the value of excitation required under load is discussed. Subsequent papers in the near future will present results which have been obtained from the application of the method and point of view here outlined to the solution of problems relating to abnormal operating conditions of synchronous machines.},

Similar hierarchical decision architectures have been proposed for microgrids. However, the control objectives in microgrids must be achieved while allowing for robust plug-and-play operation and maximal flexibility, without hierarchical decision making, time-scale separations, and central authorities. Here, we explore control and optimization strategies for the three decision layers and illuminate some possibly-unexpected connections and dependencies among them. Our analysis builds upon first-principle models and decentralized droop control. We investigate distributed architectures for secondary frequency regulation and find that averaging-based distributed controllers using communication among the generation units offer the best combination of flexibility and performance. We further leverage these results to study constrained AC economic dispatch in a tertiary control layer. We show that the minimizers of the economic dispatch problem are in one-to-one correspondence with the set of steady-states reachable by droop control. This equivalence results in simple guidelines to select the droop coefficients, which include the known criteria for load sharing.},

  abstract = {Most countries of the world have adopted renewable energy sources (RES) be-cause of consistent policy and industry support. The use of these sources is expanding and will cover a larger part of the generation capacity in the future. Thus, power systems (PS) are experiencing the high scale RES integration. For a power system dominated by RES, the electrical grid characteristics, namely, the inertia constant (Hs) and the rate of change of frequency (ROCOF), should be evaluated. Furthermore, the requirements related to these characteristics should be specified in the grid code (GC) to reflect the actual needs of the transmission system operator (TSO) and to prepare the evolution of the RES penetration level. Due to the delay in specifying or updating these GC requirements, RES that are incorporating unsuitable functionalities for the future perspective, regarding fault-ride-through (FRT) and frequency support requirements, will remain oper-ational by 2030; this will create additional constraints on the PS frequency stability after large-scale RES integration. In this paper, the impact assessment of deployed RES technologies on the Moroccan PS frequency stability is assessed by the year 2030, using MATLAB/Simulink environment. The main reason for focusing on the case study of Morocco is the country's target of installing 52\% of the energy supply from RES in the horizon of 2030.},

When in future small non-synchronous generation units replace a significant part of the synchronous power generation capacity, the total rotational inertia of the synchronous generators is decreased significantly. This causes large frequency variations that can end up in an unstable grid. A way to stabilize the grid frequency is to add virtual rotational inertia to the distributed generators. A virtual inertia can be attained for any generator by adding a short-term energy storage to it, combined with a suitable control mechanism for its power electronics converter. In this way a generator can behave like a ldquoVirtual Synchronous Generatorrdquo (VSG) during short time intervals, and contribute to stabilization of the grid frequency.},

  abstract = {The future smart grid encompasses ac-dc clusters known as ac-dc microgrids. For reliability and security purposes, each microgrid hosts a mix of synchronous-based and converter-based distributed resources. However, synchronous-based generators, in particular, are characterized by their limited reactive power capabilities because of the limitation of their excitation systems, which could lead to voltage instability problems when the hosting microgrid is islanded. AC-DC microgrids also comprise controllable thermal and electrical loads. Most modern ac-dc loads have power electronics interfaces that control the voltage at their ends, exhibiting constant power characteristics. AC-DC microgrids with high penetrations of constant power ac-dc loads are vulnerable to voltage collapse. As with other power system architectures, microgrids are subject to contingencies, e.g., a line circuit outage, during which their loadability can be jeopardized. For this reason, the work reported in this paper involved the investigation of the steady-state voltage stability of islanded ac-dc hybrid microgrids (HMGs) during contingencies. Voltage stability analysis was carried out on a 12-bus ac-dc HMG. Several case studies were designed to reveal the likelihood of voltage instability/collapse in microgrids under severe contingencies. The voltage stability analysis also shows that interfacing ac and dc microgrids does not always enhance loadability. The analysis was carried with the goal of raising awareness among microgrid planners and operators of the possibility that a voltage collapse phenomenon can develop in islanded ac-dc microgrids under extreme events. Contingency analysis should therefore be incorporated into planning and operations criteria for islanded ac-dc microgrids.},

  abstract = {This paper is the result of four years of deliberations and a survey of 50 utilities in United States and Canada. This study elaborates on the quantities that should be measured for revenue purposes, economical dispatching and voltage profile control, when voltage and current distortion and/or load unbalance are likely to occur. The underlying philosophy followed by the working group was to separate the main " product" , the 60Hz (or fundamental) terms from the " pollution" , the non-60Hz (or nonfundamental) components and their cross terms. This approach recognizes the following facts: {$\bullet$} Utilities generate and distribute nearly perfect sinusoidal voltage. {$\bullet$} The user expects nearly perfect symmetrical polyphase voltage with nearly perfect sinusoidal waveforms. {$\bullet$} In almost all the practical situations, more than 99 percent of the total active power is fundamental active power. Harmonies usually contribute with less than 1 percent of the total Watts. This work suggests the basic resolution s={\textsurd}S12 + SN2 where S1 is the fundamental apparent power, SN the nonfundamental apparent power. S1 is the {\textsurd}P12+Q12, P1 = V1/1 cos {\texttheta}1 = fundamental active power, and Q1 = V1/1 sin {\texttheta}1 = fundamental reactive power. The dominant and traditional fundamental powers, S1,P1,Q1 and the dPF= cos {\texttheta}1, are considered pivotal values in the economics of power systems and are left unchanged. The nonfundamental apparent power SN = S1{\textsurd}ITHD2 + VTHD2 + (ITHD)2(VTHD)2 {$\simeq$} (ITHD)S1 becomes the value that eventually helps to measure the "distortion" caused by the user. It ties together the current distortion (ITHD) caused by a nonlinear load and the size of the load reflected in S1. The active harmonic power PH= {$\sum$}h{$\neq$}1 Vh/h COS {\texttheta}h, is "hidden" in the terms (ITHD)(VTHD) {$>$} PH/S1and it is not a major contributor to the value of SN. The main component of SN is due to the product between the rms fundamental voltage and the rms nonfundamental current. Five field measurements proved the usefulness of this approach. Actual values monitored for a wide spectrum of distortions confirmed that -1.6\% {$<$} P//S1 {$<$} -0.2\% 19.4\% {$<$} SN/S1 {$<$} 88.7\% and the expression SN/S1 {$\simeq$} ITHD gives less than 1.5 percent error for VTHD 5 percent. For unbalanced loads, it was found necessary to go one step further and separate the fundamental apparent power Si in positive-sequence apparent power and unbalanced apparent power, SU1. The Working Group derived the resolution of apparent power from simple practical considerations and believes this paper to be a "discussion paper" meant to stimulate input from other practicing engineers or theoreticians.},

The experimental circuit is analysed by using exact analytical expressions for current and voltages determined via considering source impedance and nonlinearity, which is introduced due to supply side harmonics. Results demonstrate that; power decompositions proposed by Kusters and Moore, Fryze, Shepherd and Zakikhani, Sharon, and Czarnecki provide correct information regarding Power Factor improvement with passive compensation in nonsinusoidal voltage source-linear load, nonsinusoidal voltage source-nonlinear load and sinusoidal voltage source-nonlinear load cases. In these cases, Reactive component of Kusters and Moore's power decomposition can completely be compensated when Power Factor is maximum if there is no resonance or significant changes on load voltages in the case of compensation capacitance is inserted. The Reactive components of Fryze, Shepherd and Zakikhani, Sharon, Czarnecki's power decompositions attain minimum value when power factor is maximum. Furthermore, Kusters and Moore's Reactive Power could directly be related to the power of optimum compensation capacitance. On the other hand, power decompositions proposed by Budeanu, Kimbark and Depenbrock do not provide any useful information about optimum Reactive Power compensation with a basic capacitance in the cases nonsinusoidal voltage source-linear load and nonsinusoidal voltage source-nonlinear load although they can completely be compensated in these cases. An important observation is that; Distortion Powers of Budeanu and Kimbark, and Depenbrock's Residual Power have compensable parts; on the other hand, Kusters and Moore's Residual Reactive Power, Sharon's Complementary Power, Depenbrock's In Phase Power and Czarnecki's Scattered Power are almost constant when the power of compensation capacitor is varied. {\copyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V.

The inverter-side current controller is simpler to implement, moreover, it is shown that a damping injection can be done by a simple proportional action of the measured current. Instrumental for the proposed scheme is the proper design of the inverter-side current reference, which must guarantee that the grid-side current reaches its corresponding reference, i.e., a pure sinusoidal signal with the appropriate phase-shift. It is shown that the inverter-side current has to be distorted as much as necessary to guarantee that the grid-side current reaches its reference. The controller includes a harmonic compensation mechanism, therefore, it is aimed to properly perform under harmonic distortion operation. Numerical tests are presented to assess the performance of the proposed scheme. Experiments are under development and will be presented in the final version of the paper.},

The specific aspects related to modeling and implementation in Simscape Electrical of MATLAB/Simulink are discussed in detail for both time-domains. The comparison between the implementations is performed taking into examination three representative and widely studied grid-forming schemes: the virtual synchronous machine, the power-synchronization control, and the feedforward angle control. For the analysis, different power system dynamics are emulated, and different types of transient phenomena are applied in the simulation models. The considered events include frequency transients, phase jumps, and short-circuit faults. The comparative analysis suggests specific indications regarding limitations and suitability of phasor RMS and EMT models for grid-forming converters, contributing to the definition of possible guidelines for a proper selection of the modeling domain.},

The support the PV technology can offer in the next decades, to the rate of growth of the advanced economies as well as of the developing Countries, is very high. The incentives provided at a first stage by the European governments have resulted in the rapid growth of the photovoltaic market and in the increase of the number and quality of products offered by the industries. PV modules by many producers are nowadays commercially available and a number of power electronic systems have been put on the Market for processing the electric power produced by PV systems, especially for grid connected applications. Also the scientific literature concerning PV applications has been characterized by a strong quantitative and qualitative growth in the last decade. A huge number of papers has been written and continues to be published in many journals; moreover, high impact factor scientific journals which are specifically devoted to photovoltaic systems are printed. A significant number of scientific papers is dedicated to the control of the photovoltaic source. A simple search on the Reuters Thomson website reveals that, at the end of May 2012, about 600 papers include the Maximum Power Point Tracking among their keywords. Many authors have contributed to the scientific field of the circuits and systems ensuring the best operation of the photovoltaic generator, but a reference in this field is still lacking. Some books that try to assess the most significant improvements concerning the connection of the photovoltaic systems to the grid have been recently published"-- 1. PV modeling -- 2.

A few trigonometrical theorems which are to be used in the paper are called to mind. The paper is subdivided into three parts, an abstract of which follows. It is recommended that only that part of Part I up to formula (33) and the portion dealing with star-delta transformations be read before proceeding with Part II. Part I deals with the resolution of unsymmetrical groups of numbers into symmetrical groups. These numbers may represent rotating vectors of systems of operators. A new operator termed the sequence operator is introduced which simplifies the manipulation. Formulas are derived for three-phase circuits. Star-delta transformations for symmetrical co-ordinates are given and expressions for power deduced. A short discussion of harmonics in three-phase systems is given. Part II deals with the practical application of this method to symmetrical rotating machines operating on unsymmetrical circuits. General formulas are derived and such special cases, as the single-phase induction motor, synchronous motor-generator, phase converters of various types, are discussed. {\copyright}, 1918 by the American Institute of Electrical Engineers},

The method performance is thoroughly validated through extensive numerical simulations. In the presence of stationary emissions, we characterize the minimum resolution in terms of component frequency and amplitude. On the other hand, an experimental test bench enables us to evaluate the method's robustness in the presence of pulsating and distorted emissions.

Considerable attention is devoted to physical applications of variational methods, e.g., canonical equations, variational principles of mechanics, and conservation laws. The reader who merely wishes to become familiar with the most basic concepts and methods of the calculus of variations need only study the first chapter. Students wishing a more extensive treatment, however, will find the first six chapters comprise a complete university-level course in the subject, including the theory of fields and sufficient conditions for weak and strong extrema. Chapter 7 considers the application of variational methods to the study of systems with infinite degrees of freedom, and Chapter 8 deals with direct methods in the calculus of variations. The problems following each chapter were made specially for this English-language edition, and many of them comment further on corresponding parts of the text. Two appendices and suggestions for supplementary reading round out the text. Substantially revised and corrected by the translator, this inexpensive new edition will be welcomed by advanced undergraduate and graduate students of mathematics and physics.},

  abstract = {The two common three-leg, two-level voltage source inverters of a six-phase drive are able to produce 64 different switching states, representable as voltage space vectors in two orthogonal subspaces. The discrete output voltage of the inverter legs is usually controlled by means of a space vector modulation (SVM) technique, the aim of which is to produce the same volt-seconds as the continuous reference voltage vectors in both subspaces within a certain time frame (switching cycle). Using a simplified phase model of the machine consisting in each subspace of a voltage source and a leakage inductance, the phase currents are found to exhibit unwanted distortion harmonics. A proper sequence of voltage vectors has to be applied in order to reduce these harmonics. By allowing each inverter leg to change its output twice during the switching cycle (continuous modulation), 518400 different space vector sequences can be generated. This paper demonstrates that, among these sequences, only 11 need to be considered to modulate the reference vectors. Further simulation shows that, for a certain pair of reference vectors and leakage inductance ratio, only one of them reduces the distortion to a minimum. Due to the high computational effort, however, this optimization problem is not solvable online. To overcome this drawback, four different modulation strategies, the standard three-phase SVM, the fragmented sector mapping, the optimal interleaved and the approximated interleaved SVM, are derived from and compared with an offline optimization. Each strategy is evaluated regarding the resulting current distortion and the influence of the reference vectors as well as the inductance ratio. The harmonic current of these online modulation strategies is calculated in simulation and validated by experiments. Applying the proposed modulation techniques leads to a great reduction in the machine losses caused by switching.},

After the revision of the European F-Gas regulation 517/2014, the investigation has been even more intensified. One option for an approach for realizing an environmentally friendly switchgear for the high-voltage level is a combination of gas circuit breaker (GCB) and vacuum circuit breaker (VCB) in a series connection. Both switching concepts have advantages: the VCB can withstand very steep rising transient recovery voltages after current zero (CZ), while the GCBs are able to withstand high amplitudes of recovery voltage. In this investigation, the coupling and interaction of a series connection of a VCB and a GCB filled with carbon dioxide (CO2) is experimentally characterized in a basic study. The postarc current of the axial-magnetic-field-type VCB is identified as an important parameter influencing the interaction between both circuit breakers in the series connection and subsequently in the focus of the investigation. The different CZ behavior of a single VCB and a hybrid circuit breaker is compared. The voltage distribution across the two circuit breakers is the main assessment criterion for a series connection. In the first phase after CZ, the postarc current has a dominant influence on the voltage distribution; after that, a transition phase leads to capacitive voltage division phase. In order to control the voltage distribution, both capacitive and resistive voltage controls are investigated.},

In this paper, we first discuss some of the reasons why power-frequency lines could cause reductions in property values and review the implications of public concerns about EMF exposure for mitigation initiatives. We then summarize findings, from recent court cases as well as published literature and reports, regarding the observed magnitude and extent of reduced property values.

In animal-pollinated species, wide variation in ovule number per flower occurs, and this contrasts with wind-pollinated plants, where most species possess uniovulate flowers. This pattern is usually explained as an adaptive response to low pollen receipt in wind-pollinated species. Here, we develop a phenotypic model for the evolution of ovule number per flower that incorporates the aerodynamics of pollen capture and a fixed resource pool for provisioning of flowers, ovules, and seeds. Our results challenge the prevailing explanation for the association between uniovulate flowers and wind pollination. We demonstrate that when flowers are small and inexpensive, as they are in wind-pollinated species, ovule number should be minimized and lower than the average number of pollen tubes per style, even under stochastic pollination and fertilization regimes. The model predicts that plants benefit from producing many small inexpensive flowers, even though some flowers capture too few pollen grains to fertilize their ovules. Wind-pollinated plants with numerous flowers distributed throughout the inflorescence, each with a single ovule or a few ovules, sample more of the airstream, and this should maximize pollen capture and seed production.},

  abstract = {System modeling and stability analysis is one of the most important issues of inverter-dominated microgrids. It is useful to determine the system stability and optimize the control parameters. The complete small signal models for the inverter-dominated microgrids have been developed, which are very accurate and could be found in literature. However, the modeling procedure will become very complex when the number of inverters in microgrid is large. One possible solution is to use the reduced-order small signal models for the inverter-dominated microgrids. Unfortunately, the reduced-order small signal models fail to predict the system instabilities. In order to solve the problem, a new modeling approach for inverter-dominated microgrids by using dynamic phasors is presented in this paper. Our findings indicate that the proposed dynamic phasor model is able to predict accurately the stability margins of the system, while the conventional reduced-order small signal model fails. In addition, the virtual {$\omega$}-E frame power control method, which deals with the power coupling caused by the line impedance X/R characteristic, has also been chosen as an application example of the proposed modeling technique.},

  abstract = {Modelling the fast dynamics of power converters is of growing concern in power grids and Microgrids. Dynamic phasor (DP) concept has been widely applied to switched power converter for modelling fast transients efficiently due to the inherent frequency shift property of DPs. The dynamics introduced by the DC/AC power converters depend on the controllers, which are implemented either in the stationary frame or on the synchronous reference frame (SRF). Hybrid closed-loop modelling methods that consider DP-based power converter plant model are not established and the applicability and accuracy of such hybrid approaches are not fully understood. This paper attempts to address this gap by proposing two hybrid closed-loop modelling approaches: Hybrid DP-DQ and Hybrid DP-EMT and discusses the applicability and accuracy for various controller types. Furthermore, this paper presents a DP switched model of single and three phase two level power converter and discusses the selection of harmonics to reduce model complexity. The proposed hybrid approaches were validated against detailed switched power converter models and for a wide range of scenarios, the Hybrid DP-EMT method is found to be superior compared other methods. Finally, application dependent recommendations are made for the selection of suitable hybrid closed-loop model for the accurate simulation of single phase and three phase power converters.},

  abstract = {It is well known in the power system community that frequency is not a global variable during transients. The previously proposed frequency divider (FD) is a valid approach to estimate load bus frequencies in large transmission networks wherein the load dynamics are typically ignored. In converter-driven grids, load dynamics may have a significant impact on the local frequency dynamics. This paper determines that the FD has low accuracy under such conditions. This paper proposes a centralized dynamic phasor estimator (DPE) to track the frequency of the load buses and additionally estimate the branch current phasors and load bus voltage phasors. The key idea is to formulate the power system state-space model in the dynamic phasor domain such that grid-forming converter (GFC) bus voltage phasors and load power measurements are inputs and the load bus voltage and branch current phasors as states. The dynamic phasor of the GFC bus voltage is calculated by measuring the terminal voltage of the GFC bus and the internal frequency available within the droop-control loop of the GFC. A complex-PLL (C-PLL) is proposed to track the rotation of the load bus voltage phasors to estimate the actual frequency at the load buses. Numerical simulations are carried out on the modified WSCC 9-bus system and the IEEE 39-bus system to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

Moreover, a new approach is proposed to maintain the effectiveness of the repetitive control under variable-frequency operational scenarios. Furthermore, the control strategy employs feedforward compensation techniques to mitigate the impact of load dynamics on the regulation process.

  abstract = {Over the last 50 years, digital simulation of electric power systems has become an integral part for planning, design and operation in the power industry. The number of possibilities with respect to the purpose of a study, investigated frequency ranges, etc. with, in the past, limited computer resources has resulted in a spectrum of simulation tools, designed to handle very specific tasks. Simplifying assumptions were often needed to facilitate such a simulation. Recent system failures and power outages, partly due to increasingly sensitive operating conditions, have created a demand for more comprehensive studies and more general sim- ulation tools that overcome former limitations. With regards to time-domain simulation, this demand has led to combining the areas of transient, mid-term and long-term stability. Confronted with concerns about black start and system restoration due to a global trend to a deregulated power market, several power utilities suggested to also include the area of electromagnetic transients. However, previously made assumptions as well as technical limitations complicate the implementation of this idea: Stability programs are based on the assumption that power transfer takes place at system frequency and are therefore unable to represent rapid elec- tromagnetic transients. Electromagnetic transients programs, on the other hand, are very accurate but use too small simulation step sizes for an efficient simulation of electromechan- ical transients. A new method for simulating both types of transient phenomena with complex signals and dynamic phasors is presented in this thesis. Whereas in previous work three-phase transformations had been used to accomplish this task, this new method is applied directly in the phase-domain and not restricted to balanced three-phase systems. Several numerical aspects such as an appropriate variable representation, integration method and a control mechanism for variable simulation step sizes have been addressed. Important modeling}

The first employs a combination of the describing function method and \& \#x03BC; analysis, while the second makes use of integral quadratic constraints (IQCs). The model analyzed consists of an open-loop wing's airfoil subject to freeplay and linear time-invariant parametric uncertainties. The key steps entailed by the application of the two methodologies and their main features are critically discussed. Emphasis is put on the available insight on the nonlinear postcritical behavior known as limit cycle oscillation. It is proposed a strategy to apply IQCs, typically used to find absolute stability certificates, in this scenario, based on a restricted sector bound condition for the nonlinearity.

To perform such a comparison, accurate values of the single-diode parameters at STC are required. These were obtained using well-established numerical and iterative methods. The Newton-Raphson method was found to be most accurate for obtaining these parameters at STC. Consequently, these parameters were used to compare the methods of varying the single-diode model parameters with temperature and irradiance. MATLAB software has been developed to evaluate the performance of each method using the Shell SQ150 PV module. Results are compared with measured data and discussion of the accuracy of various methods is presented. .},

  abstract = {A novel maximum power-point tracking approach is proposed based on studies investigating the output characteristics of photovoltaic (PV) systems under partial shading conditions. The existence of partially shaded conditions leads to the presence of several peaks on PV curves, which decrease the efficiency of conventional techniques. Hence, the proposed algorithm, which is based on the modified particle-swarm optimization (MPSO) technique, increases the output power of PV systems under such abnormal conditions and has a better performance compared to other methods. The proposed method is examined under several scenarios for partial shading condition and non-uniform irradiation levels using Matlab, and to investigate its effectiveness adequately, the results of the proposed method are compared with those of the neural network technique. The experimental results show that the proposed method can decrease the interference of the local maximum power-point to cause the PV system to operate at a global maximum power-point. The efficiency of the MPSO is achieved with the least number of steady-state oscillations under partial shading conditions compared with the neural network method.},

The hybrid FPLL structure consists of a conventional SRF PLL feedback loop along with a feed forward frequency estimator loop. The advantage of this technique is that the feedback controller has to reduce only the phase error and the frequency error is eliminated by the feed forward controller. This increases the dynamic response of the system under frequency deviations. The performance of the hybrid structure is compared with the conventional SRF PLL and the former shows improved performance over the SRF PLL in terms of filtering characteristics and transient response for wide range of frequency deviations. The steady state error analysis is carried out and the necessary condition for stability is also derived. Simulations are carried out in MATLAB/Simulink and implemented in real time using an ALTERA cyclone II FPGA board. The results obtained for various grid conditions such as unbalance, harmonics, phase jump and frequency deviation demonstrate the phase-tracking ability of the technique. {\copyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Such multi-phase motor drives are nowadays considered for various applications. Multi-phase drives are invariably supplied from multi-phase voltage source inverters (VSIs) and adequate methods for VSI pulse width modulation (PWM) are therefore required. This paper deals with carrier-based PWM, where harmonic injection enables an improvement in the dc bus utilisation without moving into the over-modulation region, while still providing sinusoidal output phase voltages. A generalised concept of nth harmonic injection for n-phase inverters is presented. The viability of the proposed concept is proved by simulation taking five-phase VSI as an example. The method of fifth-harmonic injection in five-phase VSIs enables operation with pure sinusoidal voltages up to a certain reference voltage value which is smaller than the maximum achievable with the given dc link voltage. Sinusoidal PWM is further modified, by injecting other harmonics, in order to enable full utilisation of the dc bus voltage. The correlation of this PWM scheme with space vector PWM, based on utilisation of large vectors only, is established in this way. Some experimental results, illustrating application of the sinusoidal PWM in series-connected five-phase two-motor drives, are included.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a new algorithm for tracking maximum power point in photovoltaic systems. This is a fast tracking algorithm, where an initial approximation of maximum power point is (MPP) quickly achieved using a variable step-size. Subsequently, the exact maximum power point can be targeted using any conventional method like the hill-climbing or incremental conductance method. Thus, the drawback of a fixed small step-size over the entire tracking range is removed, resulting in reduced number of iterations and much faster tracking compared to conventional methods. The strength of the algorithm comes from the fact that instead of tracking power, which does not have a one-to-one relationship with duty cycle, it tracks an intermediate variable {$\beta$}, which has a monotonically increasing, one-to-one relationship. The algorithm has been verified on a photovoltaic system modeled in Matlab-Simulink software. The algorithm significantly improves the efficiency during the tracking phase as compared to a conventional algorithm. It is especially suitable for fast changing environmental conditions. The proposed algorithm can be implemented on any fast controller such as the digital signal processor. All the details of this study are presented.},

CAES will store electricity when the system has a surplus due to PV penetration during the day. Otherwise, CAES will inject power into the system at night when the PV no longer cannot be used. In this paper, the dynamic economic load dispatch (DELD) is carried out on thermal generators and CAES to determine optimal output of thermal generators and CAES operation pattern to meet the load demand for 24 hours and the Quadratic Constrained Programming (QCP) on the DELD integrated with CAES problem is solved by using the CPLEX solver to prove the effectiveness of the proposed system.},

In this paper, three techniques are proposed for solving and reducing the consequences of this problem. In the first technique, we develop a new fuzzy logic pitch angle controller. In the second technique, we design an energy-storage ultracapacitor which directly smoothes the output power of the wind turbine and enhances the performance of the MG during the islanding mode.

This paper reviews the methods used for maximum power point tracking in photovoltaic systems. These methods have been classified into conventional, intelligent, optimization, and hybrid techniques. A comparison has also been made of the different methods based on criteria such as tracking speed, efficiency, cost, stability, and complexity of implementation. From the literature, it is clear that hybrid techniques are highly efficient compared to conventional methods but are more complex in design and more expensive than the conventional methods.

  abstract = {Virtual inertia emulation could be regarded as an inevitable component of microgrids with renewable energy, enhancing microgrid inertia and damping properties. In applying this control technique, a phase-locked loop (PLL) is necessary to obtain the estimation of the system frequency data. However, the employment of PLL could cause larger frequency oscillation to the microgrid due to its dynamics. This issue would be exacerbated in a low-inertia microgrid driven by high renewable penetration, severely deteriorating the frequency stability. Thus, the effect of PLL with measurement delay is a critical issue in utilizing the virtual inertia control. To overcome such problem, this paper proposes a robust virtual inertia control for a low-inertia microgrid to minimize the undesirable frequency measurement effects, improving the microgrid frequency stability. The robust H{$\infty$} control design using a linear fractional transformation (LFT) technique is used to develop the virtual inertia control loop, considering the dynamics of PLL with measurement delay and the uncertainties of system inertia and damping. The efficacy of the proposed H{$\infty$} control method is compared to the conventional and optimum proportional-integral (PI)-based inertia control. The results show that the H{$\infty$} -based robust virtual inertia control is superior to both conventional virtual inertia control and optimum PI-based virtual inertia control against a wide range of microgrid operating conditions, disturbances, and parametric uncertainties.},

  abstract = {The concept of power angle control (PAC) of unified power quality conditioner (UPQC) provides an effective way to utilise the full capacity of series inverter of UPQC. This study deals with the operation and control of UPQC with PAC under voltage sag and swell conditions. The power angle, a resultant angle between actual source voltage and resultant load voltage, is used as a control variable. Two new control approaches, namely, fixed power angle and variable power angle, are proposed. It is shown that these approaches can affect the overall kVA loadings of shunt and series inverters. A thorough investigation on these fixed and variable power angle methods is presented in this study. A Matlab/Simulink-based detailed simulation and digital signal processor-based experimental studies are discussed to evaluate the performance of proposed two methods. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

To harness maximum power from the PV panel, the charge controller is equipped with Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) feature. An efficient algorithm for MPPT is developed which requires less iteration to reach Maximum Power Point (MPP) than the traditional Perturb and Observe (P\&O) method. Only an input voltage sensor is needed for the design and algorithm to track the MPP which makes the charge controller cost effective. The performance of this charge controller is demonstrated via simulation in Powersim (PSIM) software using the parameters of a practical solar panel (Sunflower A-300). It has been found that around 50\% less iterations are required to track the MPP than the tradition P\&O method for the proposed algorithm.},

The effect of using different types of sun tracking systems on the flat plate photovoltaic system performance for different sky states has been investigated. Several days representing different seasons have been considered. The corresponding main parameters affecting the amount of the electrical energy output and the gains have then been compared to those experienced with two traditional fixed photovoltaic systems inclined according to a yearly and a seasonal optimum slope. Additionally, five configurations of sun tracking systems have been considered while a seasonal and a yearly optimum slope have been applied to those based on rotating axes systems. Hourly data collected over thirty one days for different seasonal sky conditions have been employed. The daily collected global solar radiation and produced electrical energy as well as the electrical gains related to the different moving panels have been quantified separately for each sky state. It is found that for a completely clear day, the highest obtained gains are those related to the two-axis sun tracker systems while the day length is the main parameter affecting these gains. On the other hand, for the partially clear days, the gain amounts mainly depend on the daily clarity level factors and on the seasonal variation of day length values. For a cloudy day, however, all considered systems produced the same electrical energy. Furthermore, the horizontal position of the photovoltaic panel presented the best performance. {\copyright} 2012 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

Shunt active power filters (SAPF) can decrease the harmonic voltage distortion with a voltage-based harmonic compensation scheme. This paper presents a method for voltage-based selective harmonic compensation (SHC). Multiple complex coefficient filter (MCCF) state estimation is utilized for harmonic extraction. Stationary frame generalized integrators (SGI) provide control of the selected harmonic compensation. As the voltage-based SHC is implemented in stationary reference frame, computational efforts are reduced compared to synchronous reference framed SHC methods. In addition, the MCCF state estimator determines grid fundamental for robust grid synchronization in presence of imbalance and harmonic voltages, further decreasing computation requirements in the overall SAPF control. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed method. {\copyright} 2014 IEEE.},

Out of many renewable sources, solar energy sources that are clean, green, and emissions-free have gained wide utilization despite their intermittency nature. Several solar photovoltaic (PV) panels are connected in parallel to achieve the energy demand. In such a system, each panel operates differently due to uneven temperature and irradiation, resulting in a uniform and partial shading conditions. Thus, a unique and efficient mechanism is required to extract maximum power from uniformly and partially shaded PV systems. Many researchers across the world have developed various maximum power point tracking (MPPT) techniques to increase the efficiency and lifetime of PV systems. This study provides a unique, in-depth, and organized review of MPPT methods under four categories: classical, intelligent, optimization, and hybrid techniques. All possible selection benchmarks are considered to do a comprehensive review, which is not deliberated in the existing review literature. Based on the selection benchmarks, the advantages and disadvantages of each MPPT technique under different categories are summarized in tabulated form. To address the research gaps for further investigation in this field, a concise discussion is included at the end. This review article may find an accessible reference for engineers to understand the most useful MPPT method and to undertake extensive research in PV systems.},

  abstract = {From the Book: This book will teach you how to write specifications of computer systems, using the language TLA+. It's rather long, but most people will read only Part I, which comprises the first 83 pages. That part contains all that most engineers need to know about writing specifications; it assumes only the basic background in computing and knowledge of mathematics expected of an undergraduate studying engineering or computer science. Part II contains more advanced material for more sophisticated readers. The remainder of the book is a reference manualPart III for the TLA+ tools and Part IV for the language itself. The TLA World Wide Web page contains material to accompany the book, including the TLA+ tools, exercises, references to the literature, and a list of corrections. There is a link to the TLA Web page on http://lamport.org. What Is a Specification Writing is nature's way of letting you know how sloppy your thinking is.-Guindon A specification is a written description of what a system is supposed to do. Specifying a system helps us understand it. It's a good idea to understand a system before building it, so it's a good idea to write a specification of a system before implementing it. This book is about specifying the behavioral properties of a systemalso called its functional or logical properties. These are the properties that specify what the system is supposed to do. There are other important kinds of properties that we don't consider, including performance properties. Worst-case performance can often be expressed as a behavioral propertyforexample, Chapter 9 explains how to specify that a system must react within a certain length of time. However, specifying average performance is beyond the scope of the methods described here. Our basic tool for writing specifications is mathematics. Mathematics is nature's way of letting you know how sloppy your writing is. It's hard to be precise in an imprecise language like English or Chinese. In engineering, imprecision can lead to errors. To avoid errors, science and engineering have adopted mathematics as their language. The mathematics we use is more formal than the math you've grown up with. Formal mathematics is nature's way of letting you know how sloppy your mathematics is. The mathematics written by most mathematicians and scientists is not really precise. It's precise in the small, but imprecise in the large. Each equation is a precise assertion, but you have to read the accompanying words to understand how the equations relate to one another and exactly what the theorems mean. Logicians have developed ways of eliminating those words and making the mathematics completely formal, and hence completely precise. Most mathematicians and scientists think that formal mathematics, without words, is long and tiresome. They're wrong. Ordinary mathematics can be expressed compactly in a precise, completely formal language. It takes only about two dozen lines to define the solution to an arbitrary differential equation in the Differential Equations module of Chapter 11. But few specifications need such sophisticated mathematics. Most require only simple application of a few standard mathematical concepts. Why TLA+ We specify a system by describing its allowed behaviorswhat it may do in the course of an execution. In 1977, Amir Pnueli introduced the use of temporal logic for describing system behaviors. In principle, a system could be described by a single temporal logic formula. In practice, it couldn't. Pnueli's temporal logic was ideal for describing some properties of systems, but awkward for others. So, it was usually combined with a more traditional way of describing systems. In the late 1980s, I invented TLA, the Temporal Logic of Actionsa simple variant of Pnueli's original logic. TLA makes it practical to describe a system by a single formula. Most of a TLA specification consists of ordinary, nontemporal mathematics. Temporal logic plays a significant role only in describing those properties that it's good at describing. TLA also provides a nice way to formalize the style of reasoning about systems that has proved to be most effective in practicea style known as assertional reasoning. However, this book is about specification; it says almost nothing about proofs. Temporal logic assumes an underlying logic for expressing ordinary mathematics. There are many ways to formalize ordinary math. Most computer scientists prefer one that resembles their favorite programming language. I chose instead the one that most mathematicians preferthe one logicians call first-order logic and set theory. TLA provides a mathematical foundation for describing systems. To write specifications, we need a complete language built atop that foundation. I initially thought that this language should be some sort of abstract programming language whose semantics would be based on TLA. I didn't know what kind of programming language constructs would be best, so I decided to start writing specifications directly in TLA. I intended to introduce programming constructs as I needed them. To my surprise, I discovered that I didn't need them. What I needed was a robust language for writing mathematics. Although mathematicians have developed the science of writing formulas, they haven't turned that science into an engineering discipline. They have developed notations for mathematics in the small, but not for mathematics in the large. The specification of a real system can be dozens or even hundreds of pages long. Mathematicians know how to write 20-line formulas, not 20-page formulas. So, I had to introduce notations for writing long formulas. What I took from programming languages were ideas for modularizing large specifications. The language I came up with is called TLA+. I refined TLA+ in the course of writing specifications of disparate systems. But it has changed little in the last few years. I have found TLA+ to be quite good for specifying a wide class of systemsfrom program interfaces (APIs) to distributed systems. It can be used to write a precise, formal description of almost any sort of discrete system. It's especially well suited to describing asynchronous systemsthat is, systems with components that do not operate in strict lock-step. About This Book Part I, consisting of Chapters 1 through 7, is the core of the book and is meant to be read from beginning to end. It explains how to specify the class of properties known as safety properties. These properties, which can be specified with almost no temporal logic, are all that most engineers need to know about. After reading Part I, you can read as much of Part II as you like. Each of its chapters is independent of the others. Temporal logic comes to the fore in Chapter 8, where it is used to specify the additional class of properties known as liveness properties. Chapter 9 describes how to specify real-time properties, and Chapter 10 describes how to write specifications as compositions. Chapter 11 contains more advanced examples. The three chapters in Part III serve as the reference manual for three TLA+ tools: the Syntactic Analyzer, the TLATEX typesetting program, and the TLC model checker. If you want to use TLA+, then you probably want to use these tools. They are available from the TLA Web page. TLC is the most sophisticated of them. The examples on the Web can get you started using it, but you'll have to read Chapter 14 to learn to use TLC effectively. Part IV is a reference manual for the TLA+ language. Part I provides a good enough working knowledge of the language for most purposes. You need look at Part IV only if you have questions about the fine points of the syntax and semantics. Chapter 15 gives the syntax of TLA+. Chapter 16 describes the precise meanings and the general forms of all the built-in operators of TLA+; Chapter 17 describes the precise meaning of all the higher-level TLA+ constructs such as definitions. Together, these two chapters specify the semantics of the language. Chapter 18 describes the standard modulesexcept for module RealTime, described in Chapter 9, and module TLC, described in Chapter 14. You might want to look at this chapter if you're curious about how standard elementary mathematics can be formalized in TLA+. Part IV does have something you may want to refer to often: a mini-manual that compactly presents lots of useful information. Pages 268-273 list all TLA+ operators, all user-definable symbols, the precedence of all operators, all operators defined in the standard modules, and the ASCII representation of symbols.},

These distributed resources interface converters (DICs) are required to operate in an autonomous fashion without any communication for enhanced reliability. Conventionally, the real power-frequency droop control and the reactive power-voltage droop are adopted as the de-centralized control strategies in these DICs for the autonomous power sharing operations. However, the reactive power sharing of Q-V droop control often deteriorates if there are mismatched transmission line impedance characteristics.

In our study, correlation between carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and carbohydrate antigen (CA) 19-9, CEA and C-reactive protein (CRP), CEA and alpha-1 antitrypsin (A1AT) were evaluated in gastric and colon cancer patients. Materials and Methods: CEA was estimated by solid phase, two-site sequential chemiluminescent immunometric assay, CA19-9 by solid phase enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, CRP by latex turbidimetry method and A1AT by turbidimetry method. Results: A significant correlation was seen in levels of CEA and CA19-9 in gastric (r = 0.457, P {$<$} 0.001) and colon cancer (r = 0.451, P {$<$} 0.001) patients. Correlation between CEA and CRP was significant in gastric (r = 0.462, P {$<$} 0.001) and colon cancer (r = 0.759, P {$<$} 0.001) patients and between CEA and A1AT also, correlation was found to be significant in gastric (r = 0.631, P {$<$} 0.001) and colon cancer patients (r = 0.516, P (less-than or equal to) 0.001). Conclusion: Serum acute-phase protein concentrations, when combined with CEA increases the sensitivity of CEA and provide substantial information concerning the diagnosis of gastrointestinal cancers. They have a definite role as a significant prognostic indicator which undoubtedly correlates with progression of cancer. Combined CEA and CA19-9 positivity reflected more biologic malignant properties and were significantly correlated with lymph node metastasis, hepatic metastasis and lower rates of curative resection. Surgical outcomes of patients who were CEA and CA19-9 positive were poorer than those of patients with normal CEA and CA19-9 levels.}

Of these, 183 nurses were enrolled and 169 (83 in the MP and 86 in the EP) qualified for the intent-to-treat analysis., INTERVENTIONS: The EP consisted of 11 group sessions, each lasting 1 hour. After introductory sessions, subsequent sessions included general physical strengthening and stretching exercises as well as instructions for a home-training program. The MP consisted of 17 group sessions of 1.75 hours and one individual session of 45 minutes. In addition to the full EP, the MP included 5 psychological units, 7 segmental stabilization exercises units, and 8 ergonomic and workplace-specific units., MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: The primary study end-point variable was pain interference, and the secondary study end-point variables were pain intensity and functioning as measured with the West Haven-Yale Multidimensional Pain Inventory and the Short Form-36, respectively. These study end-point variables were defined a priori., RESULTS: There was no statistically significant difference between the 2 groups. Small-to-moderate effects were observed in both intervention programs across all study end-point variables. For pain interference, the effect size at 12 months after intervention was 0.58 in the MP and 0.47 in the EP., CONCLUSIONS: A multimodal program is not superior to a general exercise program in influencing the process leading to chronic LBP in a population of nurses with a history of pain. The most likely explanation is a common psychological mechanism leading to improved pain interference that is irrespective of the program used. Considering the lower resources of the general exercise program, the expense for a multimodal program is not justified for the secondary prevention of LBP and disability.}

  abstract = {Due to ever-increasing power demand and high renewable energy penetration, the power system's harmonics and voltage unbalancing have become significant power quality issues. In this aspect, because of the multifunctioning ability of the power electronic converters, the grid-connected power electronic converter-based distributed generations are expected to provide desired compensation whenever required. Especially in a weak grid environment, the compensation draws more attention due to constricted coupling between the voltage and current at the point of common coupling as a consequence of high grid impedance. Therefore, this article presents a feedback-based flexible compensation strategy for a weak-grid-tied distributed generation (DG) to enhance the compensation of harmonics and voltage unbalance in the system. The main uniqueness of the proposed work is to seamlessly embed a flexible harmonic loop with a fundamental current control loop for achieving three control targets: voltage harmonic compensation, DG line current harmonic rejection, and voltage unbalance compensation. Achieving control targets require voltage feedback and no need to measure nonlinear load current. In order to execute flexible harmonic compensation (i.e., from voltage harmonic compensation to DG line current harmonic rejection) through the harmonic loop, the proposed strategy generates a harmonic reference from voltage feedback and inherent current feedback. The delay introduced by the harmonic compensators is accurately compensated distinctly to improve the performance of the harmonic loop. The voltage unbalance compensation is achieved through the fundamental current control loop by improving the fundamental positive sequence voltage and decreasing negative sequence components concurrently. To enhance the flexibility between two different targets (i.e., flexible harmonic compensation and voltage unbalance compensation), the harmonic and unbalanced compensations are executed on an individual target basis, subjected to the converter's maximum current and system voltage constraints. The proposed compensation strategy offers better harmonic suppression and voltage unbalance compensation than conventional methods. Because it exactly acts upon modulation signals and directly regulates sequence components and voltage harmonics. Furthermore, the proposed control's detailed design and stability analysis is presented, and its superiority is validated through simulations and real-time experimentations.},

Instantaneous current/voltage samples have been used as inputs to artificial neural networks (ANNs). Whereas, for fault classification, prefault and postfault samples of only the three-phase currents are sufficient, for fault location, postfault samples of both currents and voltages of the three phases are necessary. To validate the proposed approach simulation studies have been carried out on two simulated power-system models: one in which the transmission line is fed from one end and another, in which the transmission line is fed from both ends. The models are subjected to different types of faults at different operating conditions for variations in fault location, fault inception angle and fault point resistance. The results of the simulation studies which are presented confirm the feasibility of the proposed approach.},

High gain angle droop control ensures proper load sharing, especially under weak system conditions. However, it has a negative impact on overall stability. Frequency-domain modeling, eigenvalue analysis, and time-domain simulations are used to demonstrate this conflict. A supplementary loop is proposed around a conventional droop control of each DG converter to stabilize the system while using high angle droop gains. Control loops are based on local power measurement and modulation of the d-axis voltage reference of each converter. Coordinated design of supplementary control loops for each DG is formulated as a parameter optimization problem and solved using an evolutionary technique. The supplementary droop control loop is shown to stabilize the system for a range of operating conditions while ensuring satisfactory load sharing.},

  abstract = {Microgrids have become an attractive option for distributed generation (DG) with increase in renewable energy sources (RES) and storage systems. The existence of both AC and DC microgrids has led to a new concept of hybrid AC/DC microgrid which consists of both AC and DC grids tied by an interlinking converter (ILC). Such hybrid AC/DC microgrid has the advantages of both AC and DC with increased efficiency and less cost since the conversion between AC and DC is reduced. The management of power in such a grid becomes important for voltage and frequency control. Different voltage and frequency control strategies have been successfully implemented within AC and DC grids, but the control of hybrid microgrid requires further attention with focus on ILC. This study presents an overview of various control schemes used for voltage and frequency regulation in standalone and transition mode operation of hybrid microgrid. A detailed study on hybrid grid structure is presented with different modes of operation. Various ILC strategies based on droop and communication-based control are presented. Based on the analysis, some recommendations are presented for future research.},

In a Smart Grids scenario, where the inertia of the generating sources is much less than at the transmission system level, electric transients simulation tools like the Electromagnetic Transients Program - EMTP become particularly important to assess the impact of distributed generation and voltage and frequency dynamics. With SFA implemented in the EMTP, very accurate results can be achieved with relatively large time steps that can trace the envelopes of transient voltages and currents around the fundamental frequency. If required, instantaneous values can be obtained directly from the 'dynamic phasor solution' obtained with SFA. This paper presents a rigorous mathematical derivation of SFA based on the Hilbert transform. Error analysis is performed in terms of the integration time step size and the width of the frequency band around the fundamental frequency. A test case illustrates the main modelling concepts.},

We first describe the centralized generation paradigm to show that its failure to provide answers for niche generation markets combined with both electricity deregulation and the more stringent environmental constraints paved the way an increasing share of distributed generation over the past years. We then show that to be a credible alternative generation paradigm, distributed generation will have to overcome significant technical, economic, regulatory and environmental hurdles.},

Many publications in literature have analysed the economic viability of such a solution, and some car manufacturers have recently started running several projects to demonstrate the technical viability of the so-called battery second life. Nevertheless, the degradation behaviour of second life batteries remains unknown and represents one of the biggest gaps in the literature. The present work aims at evaluating the effects of Lithium-ion (Li-ion) NMC/C battery State of Health (SOH) and ageing history over the second life performance, on two different applications: a residential demand management application and a power smoothing renewable integration application. The performance and degradation of second life batteries are assessed both at the cell level and at stack level. Homogeneous and heterogeneous stacks are analysed in order to evaluate the impact of cell-to-cell history and SOH differences over the battery performance and degradation behaviour. Results obtained showed a strong influence of the first life battery ageing history upon the second life battery performance and degradation. Thereby, proper monitoring and battery selection appears crucial to certify the technical viability of battery second life.},

Considering migrations between patches to be faster than local interaction allows us to study a three-dimensional system by means of a two-dimensional one. On the other hand, a two time scales periodic eco-epidemic model is addressed by considering two competing species, one of them being affected by a periodic SIR epidemic process which is faster than inter-species interactions. The difference between time scales allows us to study the asymptotic behavior of the four-dimensional system by means of a planar, reduced one. Furthermore, we propose a methodology straightforwardly applicable to a very large class of two time scales periodic systems. {\copyright} 2012 World Scientific Publishing Company.},

However, equal power sharing does not guarantee an efficient operation of the whole system. In order to achieve higher efficiency and lower energy losses, this paper proposes a tertiary control level including an optimization method for achieving efficient operation. As the efficiency of each converter changes with the output power, VR values are set as decision variables for modifying the power sharing ratio among converters. A genetic algorithm is used in searching for a global efficiency optimum. In addition, a secondary control level is added to regulate the output voltage drooped by the VRs. However, system dynamics is affected when shifting up/down the VR references. Therefore, a secondary control for system damping is proposed and applied for maintaining system stability. Hardware-in-the-loop simulations are conducted to validate the effectiveness of this method. The results show that the system efficiency is improved by using tertiary optimization control and the desired transient response is ensured with system damping secondary control.},

Until now, network controllability has been characterized only on isolated networks, while the vast majority of complex systems are formed by multilayer networks. Here we build a theoretical framework for the linear controllability of multilayer networks by mapping the problem into a combinatorial matching problem. We found that correlating the external signals in the different layers can significantly reduce the multiplex network robustness to node removal, as it can be seen in conjunction with a hybrid phase transition occurring in interacting Poisson networks. Moreover we observe that multilayer networks can stabilize the fully controllable multiplex network configuration that can be stable also when the full controllability of the single network is not stable.},

A result of the mismatches between system load and system generation, system frequency and the desired value of 50 Hz is the accumulation of time error. How equilibrium system frequency is calculated if load parameters are frequency dependent, and how can frequency be controlled. Also, how do parameters of a speed governor affect generated power.

The proposed scheme is studied for a PV array under PSCs which exhibits multiple peaks and its tracking performance is compared with that of two MPPT algorithms, namely P\&O-MPPT and IPSOMPPT.

However, for nonstationary waveforms, the FT produces large errors. Therefore, the power components based on this transform become inaccurate. A new approach based on the wavelet packet transform (WPT) for defining these power components is developed in this paper. The advantages of using the wavelet transform are that it can accurately represent and measure nonstationary waveforms, providing uniform frequency bands while preserving both time and frequency information. In addition, this paper addresses the problem of choosing the most appropriate mother wavelet for power components measurements. The results of applying both approaches to stationary and nonstationary waveforms show that the currently used definitions according to the IEEE Standard 1459-2000 result in large errors for the case of nonstationary waveforms while the proposed approach (WPT based) gives more accurate results in this situation.

The paper puts forward a new optimization approach using hybrid particle swarm optimization and simulated annealing (HPSOSA) to estimate solar cell parameters in single and double diode models using experimentally measured I-V data. The HPSOSA was capable of achieving a global minimum in all test runs and was significant in alleviating the premature convergence problem. The performance of the algorithm was evaluated by comparing it with five different optimization algorithms and performing a statistical analysis. The analysis results clearly indicated that the method was capable of estimating all the model parameters with high precision indicated by low root mean square error RMSE and mean absolute error MAE. The parameter estimation was accurately performed for a commercial (RTC France) solar cell.},

  abstract = {A cooperative control paradigm is used to establish a distributed secondary/primary control framework for dc microgrids. The conventional secondary control, that adjusts the voltage set point for the local droop mechanism, is replaced by a voltage regulator and a current regulator. A noise-resilient voltage observer is introduced that uses neighbors' data to estimate the average voltage across the microgrid. The voltage regulator processes this estimation and generates a voltage correction term to adjust the local voltage set point. This adjustment maintains the microgrid voltage level as desired by the tertiary control. The current regulator compares the local per-unit current of each converter with the neighbors' and, accordingly, provides a second voltage correction term to synchronize per-unit currents and, thus, provide proportional load sharing. The proposed controller precisely handles the transmission line impedances. The controller on each converter communicates with only its neighbor converters on a communication graph. The graph is a sparse network of communication links spanned across the microgrid to facilitate data exchange. The global dynamic model of the microgrid is derived, and design guidelines are provided to tune the system's dynamic response. A low-voltage dc microgrid prototype is set up, where the controller performance, noise resiliency, link-failure resiliency, and the plug-and-play capability features are successfully verified.},

  abstract = {Abstract Background Photovoltaic (PV) array which is composed of modules is considered as the fundamental power conversion unit of a PV generator system. The PV array has nonlinear characteristics and it is quite expensive and takes much time to get the operating curves of PV array under varying operating conditions. In order to overcome these obstacles, common and simple models of solar panel have been developed and integrated to many engineering software including Matlab/Simulink. However, these models are not adequate for application involving hybrid energy system since they need a flexible tuning of some parameters in the system and not easily understandable for readers to use by themselves. Therefore, this paper presents a step-by-step procedure for the simulation of PV cells/modules/arrays with Tag tools in Matlab/Simulink. A DS-100M solar panel is used as reference model. The operation characteristics of PV array are also investigated at a wide range of operating conditions and physical parameters. Result The output characteristics curves of the model match the characteristics of DS-100M solar panel. The output power, current and voltage decreases when the solar irradiation reduces from 1000 to 100 W/m2. When the temperature decreases, the output power and voltage increases marginally whereas the output current almost keeps constant. Shunt resistance has significant effect on the operating curves of solar PV array as low power output is recorded if the value of shunt resistance varies from 1000 ohms to 0.1 ohms. Conclusion The proposed procedure provides an accurate, reliable and easy-to-tune model of photovoltaic array. Furthermore, it also robust advantageous in investigating the solar PV array operation from different physical parameters (series, shunt resistance, ideality factor, etc.) and working condition ( varying temperature, irradiation and especially partial shadow effect) aspects},

The study is based on a model consisting of the classical swing equation characterization for generators and constant admittance, PV bus and/or PQ bus load representations which, in general, leads to a semi-explicit (or constrained) system of differential equations. A precise definition of static stability is given and basic concepts of static bifurcation theory are used to show that this definition does include conventional notions of steady-state stability and voltage collapse, but it provides a basis for rigorous analysis. Static bifurcations of the load flow equations are analyzed using the Liapunov-Schmidt reduction and Taylor series expansion of the resulting reduced bifurcation equation. These procedures have been implemented using symbolic computation (in MASYMA). It is shown that static bifurcations of the load flow equations are associated with either divergence-type instability or loss of causality. Causality issues are found to be an important factor in understanding voltage collapse and play a central role in organizing global power system dynamics when loads other than constant admittance are present.},

With SII all antibody determinations showed much lower titres. With Somatonorm (SIII), in the large majority of cases no antibodies were detectable. The titres registered in a few children were low and the binding capacities were negligible.3.The biologically determined somatomedin activity was initially pathologically low. During treatment it rose to supraphysiological levels. Also the radioimmunologically assayed somatomedin and the alkaline phosphatase increased significantly.4.At the start of the first series, two patients showed allergic skin reactions which turned out to be caused by the insufficiently purified preparations. Therapy with extractive preparations was free of such side-effects and fully successful. Both of the patients were atopic. A third child who was also allergic developed after 6-9 months the highest antibody titres seen, combined with a high binding capacity. Also, with this boy, treatment was switched over to pit-hGH, with very good results.5.Two children with pituitary dwarfism already developed in utero high antibody titres against Met-hGH but not against ECP. For this response, neither the Somatonorm nor its impurities can be implicated. Rather, it is the reaction to GH generally, which the organism recognizes as a foreign protein and thus as an antigen. One of the patients stopped growing after nine months. Likewise, pituitary GH did not lead to any further improvement. {\copyright} 1986 W.B. Saunders Company.},

  abstract = {One purpose of the reformation of electric power system in China is to enable the power system to absorb a higher proportion of renewable energy. Currently, there are still such problems for China's renewable energy as high cost price, poor power regulating ability and insufficient consumptive space. As an important means of developing renewable energy power generation, distributed generation becomes a highlight in this reformation of electric power system. Under the background of reformation in power system, we describe the current overall market situation of distributed generation and the situation of distributed photovoltaic generation in China and further analyze the future policy environment of distributed generation. At the same time, we also analyze the system, technical and economic obstacles in the development of distributed generation. Market designs are made on various aspects like the objective principle, market types (spot market, futures market, financial market, ancillary service market and retail market) and transaction modes (bilateral contract, multilateral transaction platform and power pool). We also build institutional arrangement for smooth transition mechanism, problem-solving mechanism, independent accounting mechanism in power transition and distribution, full acquisition mechanism and Renewable Portfolio Standard. Discussions on the operation mode for the distributed generation are also shown in this paper based on the policies, regulations of the reformation and technical condition (micro-grid). Through our research, we finally put forward five policy proposals to provide support to the development of distributed generation during the reformation.},

  abstract = {Distributed generation is emerging as a new technology for supplying the increasing demand for electricity. Microgrids are attracting a great deal of attention since they integrate distributed generation in the main grid reliably and cleanly. When designing the control system of a microgrid, several functions must be considered, such as the management of electrical and thermal energy, load management, synchronisation with the main grid, etc. Both companies and institutions have carried out research into the control of microgrids over recent years and many proposals can be found in the literature. Thus, the design of the control system of a microgrid is a complex task due to its multiple functions and the large number of proposed solutions. This paper presents a complete description of the main features of a microgrid and describes the characteristics of the control systems used. Details are provided of the control tasks involved and of the main types of controls proposed in the literature. In addition, this paper describes the controls used in existing microgrids all over the world and proposes future areas for research. {\copyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

This paper develops the modeling and analysis of autonomous operation of inverter-based microgrids. Each sub-module is modeled in state-space form and all are combined together on a common reference frame. The model captures the detail of the control loops of the inverter but not the switching action. Some inverter modes are found at relatively high frequency and so a full dynamic model of the network (rather than an algebraic impedance model) is used. The complete model is linearized around an operating point and the resulting system matrix is used to derive the eigenvalues. The eigenvalues (termed "modes") indicate the frequency and damping of oscillatory components in the transient response. A sensitivity analysis is also presented which helps identifying the origin of each of the modes and identify possible feedback signals for design of controllers to improve the system stability. With experience it is possible to simplify the model (reduce the order) if particular modes are not of interest as is the case with synchronous machine models. Experimental results from a microgrid of three 10-kW inverters are used to verify the results obtained from the model},

  abstract = {The tracking of power in solar PV systems depends on controlling the voltage or current to the optimum level irrespective of changes in solar irradiation. There are two aspects of maximum power point tracking (MPPT), first is to control the voltage or current and second is to find the peak power with an algorithm. This work deals with both the aspects, using current control which provides fast control response and a momentum-based MPPT algorithm for improved peak tracking. Since current programmed control gives a simple implementation and fast response of converters, it would seem obvious to link it with current referenced MPPT but this method is prone to fail when irradiation drops suddenly, leading to control loss. Voltage oriented MPPT control (which has logarithmic dependance on irradiation), with an inner current control loop is used, as it maintains control even with step changes in irradiation. The second part of this work discusses the perturb and observe (hill climbing) algorithm for finding the power peak, which is known for its simple and effective implementation. A simple modification of this algorithm by adding momentum to the hill climbing is shown to improve the speed of tracking while maintaining the oscillations around maximum power point to acceptable levels.},

  abstract = {Small-signal stability analysis in a power system uses a linearized approximation of its nonlinear model to analyze its behavior when subjected to small perturbations. In this approach, there is an implicit assumption that the perturbations are small enough so the imprecisions of the linear approximation with respect to the nonlinear model remain within an acceptable range. This restricts the validity of the linearized model to a neighborhood of the equilibrium conditions under which the model was obtained. Usually, the size and shape of this neighborhood is determined by the regions in the state-space where no protective limiters are active. However, there may be situations when a relatively small perturbation drives the system to such regions, yet there is still no threat to the stable operation of the system. This paper proposes a method to find an attraction area of the system, using a linearized model with the addition of AVR and PSS output limiters, in such a way that this area includes parts of the regions of the state space where the limiters are active, therefore widening the neighborhood of the equilibrium point where stability is guaranteed. The obtained results show that this attraction area is much larger than the neighborhood defined by the region where the linearized approximation is valid, and also indicate that the linearized model, with the addition of AVR and PSS output limiters, can provide good approximations of the nonlinear system trajectories even in some parts of the regions where the limiters are active. {\copyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

The losses due to partial shading are not proportional to the shaded area but depend on the shading pattern, array configuration and the physical location of shaded modules in the array. This paper presents a technique to configure the modules in the array so as to enhance the generated power from the array under partial shading conditions. In this approach, the physical location of the modules in a Total Cross Tied (TCT) connected PV array are arranged based on the Su Do Ku puzzle pattern so as to distribute the shading effect over the entire array. Further, this arrangement of modules is done without altering the electrical connection of the modules in the array. The Su Do Ku arrangement reduces the effect of shading of modules in any row thereby enhancing the generated PV power. The performance of the system is investigated for different shading patterns and the results show that positioning the modules of the array according to 'Su Do Ku' puzzle pattern yields improved performance under partially shaded conditions. {\copyright} 2010-2012 IEEE.},

In recent years the valuation of energy sources by the consumer became more differentiated. Today many consumers prefer various energy sources (e.g. PV or Wind) in different degrees. Taking this distinction into account causes several challenges in the market design as energy becomes a heterogeneous good. We show that already existing auction mechanisms cannot provide a satisfactory solution to represent these differences. As a result, we propose a two-step mechanism specifically tailored for the differing consumer valuations. It introduces a merit-order based market for each type of energy. Thus, each separate market deals with one source of energy and is cleared separately. With that, the determination of the chronological order of the different markets becomes essential. The proposed mechanism aims at taking the various preferences of all consumers into account by using the Borda count voting mechanism. The theoretically presented market mechanism is supported by a real-life data case study with data from the Landau Microgrid Project.},

The high penetration of distributed generators, linked to the grid through highly controllable power processors based on power electronics, together with the incorporation of electrical energy storage systems, communication technologies, and controllable loads, opens new horizons to the effective expansion of microgrid applications integrated into electrical power systems. This paper carries out an overview about microgrid structures and control techniques at different hierarchical levels. At the power converter level, a detailed analysis of the main operation modes and control structures for power converters belonging to microgrids is carried out, focusing mainly on grid-forming, grid-feeding, and grid-supporting configurations. This analysis is extended as well toward the hierarchical control scheme of microgrids, which, based on the primary, secondary, and tertiary control layer division, is devoted to minimize the operation cost, coordinating support services, meanwhile maximizing the reliability and the controllability of microgrids. Finally, the main grid services that microgrids can offer to the main network, as well as the future trends in the development of their operation and control for the next future, are presented and discussed. {\copyright} 2012 IEEE.},

  abstract = {Non-linear loads are widely used in power systems nowadays. This application leads to affect the power grid negatively by producing harmful harmonics in the form of non-sinusoidal waveforms. Hence, the definitions of reactive power in non-sinusoidal have been proposed by various researchers who each of them claims that his proposed definition is proper to be applied to defined the power definitions in non-sinusoidal conditions and under the effect of harmonics. In this paper, most of power definitions in non-sinusoidal situations are reviewed and studied. Also, the point views of each researcher are discussed and compared in details. Finally, to examine the validation of the proposed power definitions in in non-sinusoidal conditions a case study was carried out by building a circuit under harmonic effects to measure the power parameters using experimental platform and Matlab environment to provide a numerical comparison of the power values measured based on those different definitions.},

The proposed approach is not only able to restore frequency and voltage of the MG but also ensures reactive power sharing. The distributed secondary control does not rely on a central control, so that the failure of a single unit will not produce the fail down of the whole system. Experimental results are presented to show the feasibility of the DSC. The time latency and data drop-out limits of the communication systems are studied as well.},

Saturation functions that are derived, whether from test data or by the methods, of finite elements are developed. Different saturation algorithms for calculating values of excitation and internal power angle depending upon generator terminal conditions are compared.

In a steady-state, the dynamic phasors reduce to standard phasors from ac circuit theory. We performed experiments and simulations involving a three-phase induction motor and a three-phase synchronous permanent magnet motor, and we demonstrate that models based on dynamic phasors provide very accurate descriptions of observed transients.

  abstract = {We explore several basic aspects of chaos, chaotic systems, and non-linear dynamics through three different setups. The logistic map, a canonical one-dimensional system exhibiting surprisingly complex and aperiodic behavior, is modeled as a function of its chaotic parameter. We consider maps of its phase space, and the progression through period-doubling bifurcations to the onset of chaos. The Feigenbaum ratio of successive bifurcation periods is estimated at 4.674, in good agreement with the accepted value. The Liapunov exponent, governing the exponential growth of small perturbations in chaotic systems, is calculated and its fractal structure compared to the corresponding bifurcation diagram for the logistic map. Using a non-linear p-n junction circuit we analyze the return maps and power spectrums of the resulting time series at various types of system behavior. Similarly, an electronic analog to a ball bouncing on a vertically driven table provides insight into real-world applications of chaotic motion. For both systems we calculate the fractal information dimension and compare with theoretical behavior for dissipative versus Hamiltonian systems. 1. INTRODUCTION The investigation of chaos and chaotic systems is a rel-atively new area of research, with strong ties to the fields of physics and applied mathematics. Non-linear dynam-ics is the study of systems whose equations of motion contain non-linear dependence on their state variables. In fact, while chaos frequently occurs in non-linear sys-tems, it can never occur in linear systems. Several basic examples, such as the driven damped harmonic oscillator, exhibit surprising behavior as they pass into the chaotic regime. Theoretical simulation as well as direct experiment al-low us to explore non-linear dynamics and chaos theory. We discuss the defining characteristics of chaotic systems in and the connection to fractal theory in 2. We model the logistic map, a simple one-dimensional system ex-hibiting chaotic behavior, in 3. In 4 and 5 we examine two chaotic circuits, one based on the non-linear relation between current and voltage, the other an electronic ana-log of a ball bouncing on a sinusoidally driven table. For all three systems we examine the period-doubling, bifur-cation route to chaos. Where able we estimate the Lia-punov exponent, Feigenbaum ratio, and the information dimension of the attractors. We present a theoretical bifurcation diagram of the logistic map, as well as exper-imentally measured return maps of the two circuit sys-tems and the power spectrum of the resultant time series at various chaotic periods. Finally, we comment on the differences between these three systems and the various characteristics of chaotic behavior that they exhibit.},

The STATCON is gaining an important role in the provision of reactive power in electric power network. This paper presents the design and simulation of a 5kVAr, STATCON and its control algorithm. The control algorithm developed is based on {$\delta$} phase shift angle control which makes compensation instantaneous, maintain unity powerfactor without sensing associated reactive power components and substantially reduce the amplitude of line current harmonics.

  abstract = {This article proposes a fixed zone perturb and observe (FZPO) technique to achieve improved steady-state efficiency and a fast and drift-free maximum power point tracking (MPPT) for photovoltaic (PV) systems without any additional sensors. In this technique, the PV array's power-voltage (P-V) curves are divided into multiple zones with unique zone boundary voltages for different irradiance conditions. This technique employs a combination of adaptive and fixed step sizes to improve the performance, where the adaptive step size is calculated from simple mathematical equations, resulting in a reduced computational burden. Besides, natural drift-free tracking is achieved without any additional sampling or computation, overcoming existing techniques' limitations. The FZPO technique requires a PV panel's information only at the initial design stage but not during real-time tracking, making the implementation possible using only low-cost processors. This article presents the implementation and design of the proposed controller. The FZPO technique's performance is validated through a comprehensive set of hardware experiments on a buck-boost full-bridge (BBFB) converter under various irradiance conditions per the EN50530 standard. For a step change in irradiance, the FZPO technique is experimentally verified to be 42\% and 20\% more efficient than the conventional and VSS techniques, respectively. During the irradiance varying conditions using the FZPO technique, the peak power loss is one-sixth compared to the conventional and VSS techniques. Practical field-related considerations, such as PV panel temperature effects, are further investigated through experiments.},

Many control strategies, such as droop control, master-slave control, and average current-sharing control, have been extensively implemented worldwide to operate parallel-connected inverters for load sharing in DG network. Among these methods, the droop control technique has been widely accepted in the scientific community because of the absence of critical communication links among parallel-connected inverters to coordinate the DG units within a microgrid. Thus, this study highlights the state-of-the-art review of droop control techniques applied currently to coordinate the DG units within a microgrid.},

It provides power flow, optimal power flow, state estimation, topological graph searches, and short-circuit calculations according to IEC 60909. pandapower includes a Newton-Raphson power flow solver formerly based on pypower, which has been accelerated with just-in-time compilation. Additional enhancements to the solver include the capability to model constant current loads, grids with multiple reference nodes, and a connectivity check. The pandapower network model is based on electric elements, such as lines, two- and three-winding transformers, or ideal switches. All elements can be defined with nameplate parameters and are internally processed with equivalent circuit models, which have been validated against industry standard software tools. The tabular data structure used to define networks is based on the Python library pandas, which allows comfortable handling of input and output parameters. The implementation in Python makes pandapower easy to use and allows comfortable extension with third-party libraries. pandapower has been successfully applied in several grid studies as well as for educational purposes. A comprehensive publicly available case study demonstrates a possible application of pandapower in an automated time-series calculation.},

Anti-islanding protection aims to disconnect distributed generators immediately after the opening of a recloser. As a consequence, after the reclosing operation, voltage sag will occur in some parts of the distribution system, since the loads are energized immediately but the generators are no longer present. In this context, this work presents the findings on our investigations about this problem. The results show that the resulting voltage sag level can violate power-quality limits. Thus, a set of indices has been introduced to characterize the severity of the voltage sag, and a load flow-based method has been proposed to predict the phenomenon. Sensitivity studies are also conducted in order to identify some key factors that influence this type of voltage depression. {\copyright} 1986-2012 IEEE.},

DEA efficiencies have been obtained under various input/output combinations. A ranking of dot com firms in terms of relative efficiency has been obtained. A method based on multivariate analysis has been proven to be successful at showing the strengths and weaknesses of individual dot com firms.

It examines two different solar energy technologies, namely, solar photovoltaic (PV) and solar water heaters (SWHs), to understand how different pathways for low-carbon innovation are supported and constrained by (the lack of) political support at the national and local level, the interactions between state and nonstate actors, as well as how they relate to changing practices among consumers. This article also discusses obstacles and trade-offs. We find two very different approaches to solar energy. The solar PV industry in China is experiencing increased domestic growth, after many years of being mainly export-oriented. Prices declined rapidly in recent years, and solar PV also enjoys much political and financial support from the central government and local governments. However, there are high bureaucratic and technical hurdles to get grid connected and access the feed-in-tariff, particularly for individual users. SWHs on the other side are a \&ldquo;homegrown\&rdquo; Chinese technology that is ubiquitous in China, particularly in rural areas; that is easy to install and use; and that has developed from the grassroots levels to mass products with relatively little government support. Although being largely neglected by high-level discussions and plans, SWHs could contribute much to low-carbon transitions that are driven at the local level in China.{$<$}br/{$>$} \&copy; 2018, \&copy; The Author(s) 2018.},

This article presents a novel modeling approach for the ac-ac DAB converter using the extended generalized average modeling (EGAM) technique. Unlike the conventional generalized average modeling (GAM) framework, the ac-ac DAB converter's dynamic state variables, including the leakage inductor current and ac grid side LC filters, exhibit grid and switching frequency components, making the standard GAM framework unsuitable for dynamic modeling involving two distinct excitation frequencies. Furthermore, the 2-D GAM (2D-GAM) framework, although capable of capturing the dynamics of two frequencies and their cross interactions, fails to handle product terms involving double fourier series (DFS) states resulting from the switching terms in the ac-ac DAB converter. To address these challenges, the EGAM technique is proposed, which involves transforming the DFS product terms in the time domain into the 2D-convolution of their discrete fourier images (DFI) in the frequency domain. As a consequence of this analysis, it is shown that in an ac-ac DAB converter, the power is transferred in the grid-switching sideband frequency components at the bridge level. The effectiveness of the EGAM modeling framework is demonstrated through extensive simulation and hardware experiments, and the results are compared with PLECS results, validating the accuracy and efficacy of the proposed approach.},

Symmetrical components technique for analysing quasi-stationary unbalanced power system transients is extended to cover the low pass time-varying phasors. It is also proved that the time varying phasors can be used for computing the fast electromagnetic transients within the linear RLC lumped parameter representation of the transmission network irrespective of the transient speeds. In linear networks, this time-varying phasor concept unifies two classical approaches: (1) transient analysis using instantaneous currents and voltages, and (2) steady state analysis using traditional phasors, into analysing both behaviours precisely using the time-varying phasors. {\copyright} 1994.},

  abstract = {This paper provides an overview of the taxonomy theory which has been proposed as a fundamental platform for solving practical stability related problems in large constrained nonlinear systems such as the electric power system. The theory reveals a two-level intertwined cellular nature of the constrained system dynamics which serves as a unifying structure, a taxonomy, for analyzing nonlinear phenomena in large system models. These broadly divide into the state space aspects (related to dynamic stability issues among others) and the parameter space aspects (connected with bifurcation phenomena among others). In the state-space formulation, the boundary of the region of attraction for the operating point is shown (under certain Morse-Smale like assumptions) to be composed of stable manifolds of certain anchors and portions of the singularity surface. Such boundary characterization provides the foundation for rigorous Lyapunov theoretic transient stability methods. In the parameter space analysis, the feasibility region which is bounded by the feasibility boundary provides a safe operating region for guaranteeing local stability at the equilibrium under slow parametric variations. The feasibility boundary where the operating point undergoes loss of local stability is characterized in the form of three principal bifurcations including a new bifurcation called the singularity induced bifurcation. An overview of the recent results which prove that the two-level structure exists even in nonmsooth models that incorporate the effects of system hard limits is also included. Specifically hard limits induce a number of new bifurcations. This natural taxonomy of the system dynamics stands as the backbone for developing practical and rigorous computational techniques in detecting diverse instability mechanisms. {\copyright} 1995 IEEE},

Moreover, these models are interpreted from a circuital point of view, providing the electrical circuits constituted only by basic electrical components.

The one-axis model is adopted for representint the synchronous machine, which consists of a salient-pole hydrogenerator. Then the AVR and PSS models, defined in IEEE Standards 421.5 (2005) and 1110, are presented. The model used to represent the PSS was PSS1A (single-input), defined in Standard 421.5. The DAE equations of the system are numerically integrated and the system is simulated under perturbation and its dynamical response is analyzed. Hopf Bifurcation ocurrences are investigated by parametrization of the system eigenvalues as functions of the controllers gains and time constants. The Bifurcation Diagrams of the system were also determined and plotted. Based on Dynamical Nonlinear Systems Stability Region Theory, the simulations are utilized to build up a Brute-Force Method (BFM) to estimate the Stability Region in four situations: open-loop system (no controllers), controlled by AVR solely, AVR and PSS controlled and without saturators, AVR and PSS controlled but with saturators. Also, the Region is also estimated for various values of controllers parameters (gains). These estimatives are further compared so as to conclude about the controllers impacts on the size of the Stability Region. The main conclusion is that while the open-loop system detains the widest Stability Region, that Region is extremely decreased by inclusion of AVR; the further introduction of the PSS widens back the Region, and finally the introduction of saturators significantly reduces the size of Stability Region. Moreover, when the controllers gains are increased, the Region tends to shrink. Consequently, high gains and saturators have a detrimental effect in the size of the Stability Region and in the margin of transitory stability of power systems.},

This paper presents a mathematical foundation of Dynamic Phasors (DP) Transform, using differential equations and Fourier analysis results. By means of modelling and simulation of a particular inverter system, DP modelling is exemplified and an Equivalent Phasor Model is constructed. Using the simulation results, we discuss the shortcomings of Quasi-Static (QS) Modelling, adopted in the majority of modern Electric Power System (EPS) studies, and why it is not suitable for modelling inverter systems. Moreover, we prove that DPs are a better candidate for the formalization of Time-Varying Phasors in EPSs. Finally, we show that the DP framework offers an accurate strategy to model and simulate inverter systems, because, unlike QS models, it is able to re-construct the non-sinusoidal signals that satisfy the system differential equations while offering a unique phasorial representation for such signals.},

Moreover, an adaptive total sliding-mode control system is designed for the current control of the PWM inverter to maintain the output current with a higher power factor and less variation under load changes. In addition, an adaptive step-perturbation method is proposed to achieve the objective of maximum power point tracking, and an active sun tracking scheme without any light sensors is investigated to make PV plates face the sun directly in order to capture maximum irradiation and enhance system efficiency. Experimental results are given to verify the validity of the high step-up converter, the PWM inverter control, the ASP method, and the active sun tracker for a grid-connected PV generation system. {\copyright} 2008 IEEE.},

This paper surveys advances in pinning control approaches to making a dynamical networked system have a desired behavior. For a network with fixed topology, we review the feasibility, stability and effectiveness of pinning control. We then focus on pinning-based consensus and flocking control of mobile multi-agent networked systems. One of the main challenges with consensus and flocking control is that the topology of the corresponding dynamical network is time-varying, which depends on the states of all the agents in the network. Looking forward to the next decade, we expect to have a much deeper understanding of the relationship between the effectiveness of pinning control and the structural properties of a complex network, which may result in better control of large scale networked systems. {\copyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

The phase lag resulting from the digital computation and modulation delays is thus compensated by the virtual capacitor. The frequency region that allows using resonant controllers is then identified with the virtual damper. It reveals that the upper frequency limit of harmonic resonant controllers can be increased above the gain crossover frequency defined by the proportional gain of current controller. This is of particular interest for high-performance active harmonic filtering applications and low-pulse-ratio converters. Case studies in experiments validate the theoretical analysis. {\copyright} 2014 IEEE.},

How to employ massive smart meter data to promote and enhance the efficiency and sustainability of the power grid is a pressing issue. To date, substantial works have been conducted on smart meter data analytics. To provide a comprehensive overview of the current research and to identify challenges for future research, this paper conducts an application-oriented review of smart meter data analytics. Following the three stages of analytics, namely, descriptive, predictive and prescriptive analytics, we identify the key application areas as load analysis, load forecasting, and load management. We also review the techniques and methodologies adopted or developed to address each application. In addition, we also discuss some research trends, such as big data issues, novel machine learning technologies, new business models, the transition of energy systems, and data privacy and security.},

After all, individuals have strong incentives to 'free-ride' and therefore not contribute to the provision of public goods.

However, the output power induced in the photovoltaic modules is influenced by an intensity of solar cell radiation, temperature of the solar cells and so on. Therefore, to maximize the efficiency of the renewable energy system, it is necessary to track the maximum power point of the input source. In this paper, a new maximum power point trucker (MPPT) using fuzzy set theory is proposed to improve energy conversion efficiency. Fuzzy algorithm based on linguistic rules describing the operator's control strategy is applied to control step-up converter for MPPT. Fuzzy logic control based on coarse and fine mode has been incorporated in order to reduce not only the time required to track the maximum power point but also fluctuation of power. MPPT algorithm is implemented by 16 bit single chip 80C196KB microcontroller. Simulation and experimental results show that performance of fuzzy controller in maximum power tracking of photovoltaic array is better than that of controller based upon hill climbing method.},

  abstract = {Low torque ripple level is the prerequisite for surface-mounted permanent magnet synchronous machines to maintain control accuracy and speed stability. Since the speed harmonic's amplitude is proportional to the torque harmonic's amplitude, torque ripple can be reduced by speed harmonic minimization. Harmonic injection method is a practical speed harmonic minimization method. But current harmonic regulation and complex theoretical derivation are required in existing methods. What's more, the effectiveness of many methods will deteriorate when the parameters of permanentmagnet synchronous machine (PMSM) and proportional integral (PI) controllers vary. In order to avoid the influence of parameter variations and complex algorithms, an amplitude-phase-based optimal voltage harmonic injection method is proposed for speed harmonic minimization in this article. The influence of the injected voltage harmonic's amplitude and phase on the speed harmonic's amplitude is first analyzed. Then, a simple speed harmonic controller based on the optimization of injection voltage harmonic's amplitude and phase is designed. The proposed method does not rely on the motor parameters. Moreover, the proposed method is easy to implement. It does not need to regulate current harmonics. The proposed method is simulated and experimentally evaluated under both steady-state and transient conditions.},

However, most real networks often consist of local units, which interact with each other via asymmetric and heterogeneous connections. In this paper, pinning control of a continuous-time complex dynamical network with general coupling topologies is studied. Some generic stability criteria based on master stability function (MSF) are derived for such a general controlled network, which guarantee that the whole network can be pinned to its equilibrium by placing feedback control only on a small fraction of nodes. Then, these results are extended to discrete-time case. Previous results about symmetric, uniform or linear coupled networks in this area are included as special cases of the present work. Numerical simulations of directed networks with weighted coupling pinned by specifically selective pinning scheme are given for illustration and verification. {\copyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Although the idea of QSS model is intuitive, its theoretical foundation has not yet been developed.

Two major achievements have been introduced: 1) application of DPs for multi-source, multi-frequency systems; 2) modeling of systems with time-varying frequencies. These two techniques enable the use of DPs to study nearly all types of electrical power systems (EPS). The developed theory is validated using a twin-generator system from the More Open Electrical Technologies (MOET) project. The accuracy and effectiveness of the developed models is confirmed by comparing the simulation results of detailed switching models and DP models under both balanced and unbalanced conditions.},

Two major factors that limit the adoption of existing hierarchical control in microgrid are the low accuracy in reactive power sharing and the requirement for complex communication infrastructure. This paper addresses this problem by proposing a novel distributed primary and secondary control for distributed generators dispersed in a multi-bus microgrid. The proposed method realizes voltage control and accurate reactive power sharing in a distributed manner using minimum communication. Each distributed generator only needs its own information and minimum information from its neighboring units. Topology of the network can be flexible which supports the plug-and-play feature of microgrids. In a distribution system, high R/X ratio and system imbalance can no longer be neglected and thus the sequence component analysis and virtual impedance are implemented in the proposed control framework. The proposed framework is validated by simulation results on a MG testbed modified from the IEEE 13-bus distribution system.},

Specifically, multiple point forecasting models are first trained based on the bootstrap sampled training datasets and different forecasting models. Then, bootstrap is applied again to the multiple point forecasts. Finally, the quantiles are estimated according to the distribution of the sampled point forecasts. Two common machine learning methods, random forest (RF) and gradient boosting regression tree (GBRT), are combined to test the feasibility of the proposed forecasting framework. Compared with quantile RF (Q-RF) and quantile GBRT (Q-GBRT), numerical experiments demonstrate its advantage over Q-RF and Q-GBRT.},

This paper aims to clarify and recognize the difference between gridfollowing (GFL) and grid-forming (GFM) frequency-voltage support more intuitively and clearly. Firstly, the phasor model considering circuit constraints is established based on the port circuit equations of the converter. It is revealed that the voltage and active power linearly correspond to the horizontal and vertical axes in the phasor space referenced to the grid voltage phasor. Secondly, based on topological homology, GFL and GFM controls are transformed and mapped into different trajectories. The topological similarity of the characteristic curves for GFL and GFM controls is the essential cause of their uniformity. Based on the above model, it is indicated that GFL-VSC and GFM-VSC possess uniformity with regard to active power response, type of coupling, and phasor trajectory. They differ in synchronization, power coupling mechanisms, dynamics, and active power-voltage operation domain in the quasi-steady state. Case studies are undertaken on GFL-VSC and GFM-VSC integrated into a four-machine two-area system. Simulation results verify that the dynamic uniformity and difference of GFL-VSC and GFM-VSC are intuitively and comprehensively revealed.},

Science teacher educators have acknowledged that this focus is limited, as the induction years of beginning teachers are an important component of teacher development. This mixed methods study focuses on the induction years of beginning content specialists, with the intention of adding to the literature in this underexamined area. The secondary science teachers in this study were followed during their first and second year of teaching in order to understand the changes in their beliefs, pedagogical content knowledge (PCK) and practices as a group, and as they participated in different induction programs. Analysis by induction program revealed that first year teachers who participated in science specific induction programs strengthened their beliefs, PCK, and practices. By the end of the second year, regardless of program, most of the teachers shared similar beliefs and PCK. However, the teachers in the science specific induction programs continued to enact more interactive learning environments that had more investigations and laboratories than did their peers in the other induction programs. For those who work with beginning science teachers, this study suggests that the induction of science specialists is an important area of work. It also explores the complex process of induction, and calls for more research into how beginning secondary science teachers learn and what types of induction experiences can best support beginning science teachers.

Second, to prove that the system can be globally asymptotically stabilized with a decentralized PI control that exploits its passivity properties. Close connections between the proposed PI and the popular Akagi's PQ instantaneous power method are also established. Third, to reveal the transient performance limitations of the proposed controller that, interestingly, is shown to be intrinsic to PI passivity-based control. Fourth, motivated by the latter, an outer-loop that overcomes the aforementioned limitations is proposed. The performance limitation of the PI, and its drastic improvement using outer-loop controls, is verified via simulations on a three-terminal benchmark example. A final contribution is a novel formulation of the power flow equations for the centralized references calculation.},
